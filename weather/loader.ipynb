These reactions are of utmost importance for cellular functionality since cytosolic precursors pose a major threat of cellular proteostasis and are major drivers in aging and for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the biology of cytosolic precursors is largely elusive.\\nIn vitro import assays governed the experimentation platform of the mitochondrial community which enabled exquisite breakthroughs in understanding translocation, but are unsuited to elucidate cytosolic reactions. MitoCyto aims to break out of these experimental walls to elucidate the biology of cytosolic precursors with an interdisciplinary research team that leaves the comfort zone of biochemistry to utilize genetic and cell biology approaches but also develops novel cutting-edge techniques from high throughput approaches, through microfluidics-assisted microscopy to synthetic biology. From this innovative combination, detailed mechanistic insights into three so far largely elusive aspects of cell biology will be possible for the first time: (1) What are the cytosolic interactors of mitochondrial precursor proteins? (2) What are the direct and indirect physiological consequences of cytosolic precursor accumulation? (3) How does the re-routing of mitochondrial proteins to the nucleus control growth and fitness of eukaryotic cells?\\nWe are convinced that MitoCyto will break grounds to a comprehensive understanding of how eukaryotic cells maintain a healthy proteome over a lifetime despite fluctuating metabolic conditions.

They conquered Eurasia along a rapid “Out of Africa” movement but left Europe empty during almost 1 million years. Western Europe did indeed face environmental constraints. This subcontinent is in a remote corner of Eurasia but other large Eurasian peninsulas are dead-ends as well. Certainly, Western Europe mixture of various environments and topographies did change a lot over time and the succession of climates, then causing favorable territories for human occupations to fluctuate. However, archaeology in Asia and the Levant shows that hominins did overcome variable climatic conditions and geographies.\\nInvestigating why Western Europe have remained out of the “Oekoumen” for so long is our research proposal LATEUROPE, that we base over datasets of interdisciplinary and behavioral materials enriched by future fieldworks in several specific sites and biomes on the key period before 500 ka. This will question at the local, regional and continental scale, the environmental, geographic and climatic conditions of Europe as compared to the rest of Eurasia and the characteristics of the hominin occupations and behaviours, or/and if a minimum degree of cognition was required to thrive in these lands. Databases will input multiple scenarios combining migration patterns and internal evolution mechanisms, using conceptual modeling and spatial agent-based simulations. This formalized combination of modeling and field methodologies is an epistemological advance for bringing interdisciplinarity to reality, allowing us to deeply question the ability of Homo species to adapt themselves to harsh environments, to face environmental shocks and changes on a long term scale. \\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052653'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2558250'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999997930,\"legalName\":\"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75794\",\"street\":\"RUE MICHEL ANGE 3\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8476256\",\"longitude\":\"2.2640027\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"2558250\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['LATEUROPE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:54.141+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052653/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052653/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2558250'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-09-27T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:54.125+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101052653'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2023-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052699', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052699/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'BERGMAN ISLAND', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'BERGMAN ISLAND', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '6552998FD36837152788A56F7887A6CA256DA0DD828C170552A3DBFE849006A5', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:56.429+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['BERGMAN ISLAND'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101052699_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Bande-annonce\",\"description\":\"Trailer du film\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project coordination and sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-06-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5eddd5635/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052699_2_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Affiche\",\"description\":\"Poster du film\",\"code\":\"Other\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project coordination and sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-06-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5eddd5732/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['6552998FD36837152788A56F7887A6CA256DA0DD828C170552A3DBFE849006A5'], 'objective': [\"Kinology, agent de ventes internationales depuis 2008 présente ici un groupe de 20 distributeurs chevronnés prévoyant de sortir le film Bergman Island de Mia Hansen-Love dans 24 pays éligibles MEDIA entre l'automne 2021 et 2022.

These are experienced distributors which have been supporting independent cinema, particularly European, for years. Many of them have been supporting Mia Hansen-Love\\\\u0027s films for a long time. These distribution companies were therefore familiar with Mia Hansen-Love\\\\u0027s unique universe and, from the market launch at Cannes 2018, were particularly excited by the film. Several distributors actually pre-bought the film at the script stage. Others made their offers after seeing the first images of the film, presented a year later at Cannes 2019. The film has been sold in most of the World (Kinology has the rights in the World excluding co-producing countries), through a very effective pre-sales strategy, then via targeted taylor-made marketing campaign and thanks to the selection of the film in Official Competition at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. BERGMAN ISLAND is a true European work, produced in France, shot in Sweden (mostly), a French-Swedish-German-Benelux coproduction, with a strong international potential. Beyond the European production of the picture, it appeared quite natural to think the whole life of the film as a European project, including its distribution all around theatres in Europe .\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Kinology took care of gathering the distributors in order to create a pan-European strategy around the film, allowing us to pool marketing elements (poster, trailer, press campaign) and ideas around the release of the film. Kinology has thus set up several tools for distributors to brainstorm and share their strategies: breakfast in Cannes, zoom meeting, WhatsApp group. Ideas emerged and were exchanged around a few key themes for the film\\\\u0027s release: beyond the European filmgoers who already appreciate the director\\\\u0027s work, the possibility of accompanying the release with a Bergman and/or Mia Hansen-Love retrospective, or events linked to Sweden and Bergman to attract fans, but also mobilisation around the feminist theme (as it is a film written and directed by a woman, which speaks precisely about writing and film-making by a woman, and thus about the place of women in film-making. The film was released in France on July 14th 2021 and theatrical releases in the rest of the World are still going from then with most European releases taking place in winter/spring 2022. \\\\nIn Cannes, we also organised a « press junket » so that distributors (even those who could not attend the festival) could benefit from press coverage in the local media: interviews with the director and cast, in-depth articles on Bergman\\\\u0027s legacy or new French women directors, etc. Kinology, in collaboration with the producer and the distributor in France, brought the entire film team (including Tim Roth) to Cannes, paying for the cast\\\\u0027s plane tickets. We hired a special camera crew to allow filmed interviews for the international press. The presence of the cast at the Cannes Film Festival not only gave European journalists access to unavailable talent (who would not be able to travel for every local release) but also provided a great pan-European communication tool, allowing the film to reach the audience in the World. European press articles derived from Cannes screenings and press junket allowed the film to start its public communication campaign throughout Europe.\",\"finalResults\":\"All the work done with regards to European sales and coordination between distributors allowed the film to have a great press coverage in Europe, and to efficiently plan ambitious marketing campaigns in each of the MEDIA territories (based on \\\\\"international materials\\\\\" created by Kinology or by exchanged local posters and trailers between European distributors).\\\\nHowever, several ambitious ideas born from the above-mentionned coordinated activities could not be carried out eventually, particularly because of the situation of independent cinema in Europe (situation worsened by the rebound of the COVID epidemic from November/December 2021): distributors had to face the difficulties for independent films to attract audience and then had to reduce the P\\\\u0026A costs initially envisaged, in view of the possible revenues expected and to a certain extent constrained by the profitability imperative.\\\\nDespite fluctuations of the COVID situation, all distributors decided to stick with their convictions and favour a theatrical release rather that a digital release for this film.

La mission de cet Atelier est aussi d’apprendre aux participants à développer en commun une commande de production.\\\\nLa formation se déroule en France, en Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni, de début octobre à fin août.

Cette année, l’écriture et le développement du film ENTRE LES VAGUES, porté par le duo de la réalisatrice Anaïs Volpé et de la productrice Caroline Nataf, a permis à l\\\\u0027Atelier de rencontrer une jeune productrice, qui produit aussi bien des documentaires que des fictions, défendant dans ce cas le 2ème film d\\\\u0027une jeune réalisatrice. En parallèle la présentation du film ONODA, pour montrer la diversité de la production française, a permis à l\\\\u0027Atelier de rencontrer le producteur Nicolas Anthomé, qui a porté pendant des années le projet d\\\\u0027un jeune réalisateur français, Arthur Harari, pour donner vie à un film entièrement tourné en décor naturel à l\\\\u0027étranger, en langue japonaise, grâce à de multiples partenaires de coproduction. Autour de ces deux études de cas, se sont construites des interventions avec des financeurs publics et privés, des distributeurs, des vendeurs et des diffuseurs, réunissant les différents partenaires de financement d\\\\u0027un film, encadrées par des interventions ponctuelles sur le contexte de la production et l\\\\u0027économie du cinéma en France. \\\\nDans le cadre de cette session, une participation au Festival du Court-Métrage de Clermont-Ferrand a été l’occasion de découvrir un large panorama de courts-métrages français et étrangers, portés par de jeunes réalisateurs émergents. Les étudiants ont profité de cette manifestation à taille humaine pour rencontrer des réalisateurs et des producteurs, formaliser des contacts déjà noués et sceller de futures collaborations avec les professionnels du secteur. \\\\nAprès un passage à la Berlinale, la session de Londres s\\\\u0027est tenue du 21 février au 4 mars, mise en place en collaboration avec le département production de la NFTS, en présence de leurs étudiants de 2ème année ainsi que les étudiants production de 2ème année de La Fémis. Elle a permis d\\\\u0027appréhender de l’intérieur le système de production et de distribution britannique et d’en saisir les spécificités, que ce soit en matière d\\\\u0027écriture ou de financement, par rapport au système européen. Les évolutions du secteur toujours au cœur des interventions de la formation, ont abordé l’avenir et les enjeux de l’industrie du streaming et mis l’accent sur les méthodes et les logiques de la production financée par les nouvelles plateformes de diffusion.\\\\nLors de cette première session, les participants ont rencontré les scénaristes de La Fémis ayant répondu à l\\\\u0027appel à projets pour choisir les trois scénarios que chacun des trois duos produira en France.

Ces stages permettent aux participants de mieux connaître, en immersion et sur une courte durée, les activités menées par des sociétés avec lesquelles ils seront amenés à collaborer en tant que futurs producteurs. Les métiers de la distribution et des ventes internationales attirent parfois certains qui rejoignent les rangs des structures dans lesquelles ils ont fait leur stage. De plus, l\\\\u0027environnement international, dynamique et hautement compétitif du Marché du Film du Festival de Cannes est un lieu idéal pour se confronter à ces métiers exigeants, sans cesse en évolution.\\\\nPar ailleurs, ces stages revêtent un double objectif : mieux connaître les domaines de la distribution et des ventes internationales, proches partenaires de la production, et développer leur réseau professionnel. Leurs compétences relationnelles et professionnelles sont également testées dans les environnements très différents dans lesquelles ils sont amenés à faire leur stage : structure de grande ampleur disposant de nombreux services en interne et d\\\\u0027un nombre de collaborateurs conséquent, ou petite société au fonctionnement plus familial, où les tâches peuvent être plus diversifiées et impliquer davantage de responsabilités. Cette année encore les stages auront lieu dans les trois pays du programme - France, Allemagne, Grande-Bretagne - mais aussi en Espagne dans le pays d\\\\u0027origine de l\\\\u0027une des participants.\\\\nCes stages permettent également de faire connaître l\\\\u0027Atelier au sein des structures et par ce biais au sein de l\\\\u0027industrie plus en général. Chaque année des jeunes gens employés dans ces entreprises de distribution et de ventes contactent l\\\\u0027Atelier pour connaître les conditions d\\\\u0027admission et se porter candidat à la future édition de la formation.\\\\nC\\\\u0027est aussi dans le cadre de cette 1ère session que se créent les liens avec les étudiants des écoles partenaires.

À l\\\\u0027heure où le public international manifeste une grande appétence pour le cinéma de patrimoine, où les débouchés s’élargissent avec la multiplication des canaux et formules de diffusion, et où, dans le même temps, les technologies, les pratiques de consommation des images et l’environnement réglementaire sont en pleine mutation, le MIFC a pour mission de fédérer, de structurer et de renseigner cette filière au niveau européen et international pour dynamiser son économie, favoriser la promotion et la diffusion de ses œuvres et assurer la diversité du patrimoine cinématographique européen. Une fois par an, à l’occasion du festival Lumière qui célèbre le cinéma classique, le MIFC rassemble pendant 4 jours tous les professionnels de la chaîne de cette industrie dans un lieu dédié, et leur propose : des débats éditorialisés en prise directe avec l’actualité juridique, technique, politique, économique de la filière, des datas, des études de cas et des ateliers, des projections mais aussi des espaces de travail propices au BtoB, ainsi que des rendez-vous conviviaux favorisant les rapprochements. Le MIFC, facilitateur de rencontres et entremetteur de projets, a pour objectif de développer les échanges commerciaux - qu’il s’agisse de vente de droits, d’accords de diffusion ou de prestations techniques ou de services -, de présenter des pratiques innovantes exportables, de contribuer à la définition de nouveaux modèles économiques dynamiques et vertueux.

The objective of Hulahop’s mini slate was to strengthen Hulahop’s position on both the regional and European market. Our aim was to  lay foundations for co-productions with companies from countries with different production capacities, increase the visibility of the company and its projects on film festivals and markets, as well as increase the number and ambition of projects in development.\\\\n\\\\nTriumphs of Modernism deal with some of the most daring and important architectural feats of the Yugoslavian regime. Architecture was used as a means to represent the new, open, Non-Aligned Yugoslav society. The series in its 4 episodes takes us to Zagreb, Belgrade, Zenica, Sarajevo, and a small Belgian city of Wevelgem. In those cities, we explore how architecture represented the foundations of the Yugoslav society: federative state, non-alignment, modernisation, and antifascism. In the series we feature buildings, monuments, and cities that embodied those ideals. Through the stories of abandoned architecture, we explore the abandoned social ideas in order to raise awareness about the European tangible and intangible cultural/social heritage and the need for its preservation. Our goal was to develop and produce high-quality TV content, increase its visibility, marketability, and dissemination potential in order to be competitive in the international market and reach wider audiences.\\\\n\\\\nEuropean Union Wolf takes us to Bukovica, a small Croatian region near the Adriatic coast. Bukovica is socially isolated and completely unattractive to tourists that spend their time on the beaches. There, people live from their sheep and goat herds. However, wolves started coming, killing the herds and creating big problems for the villagers. The villagers have no doubt - the Croatian government, in an agreement with Brussels, systematically populates the area with wolves, flying them from abroad with helicopters. Their goal is simple - to disperse the local population and make space for new industries. Through the main character, Ana, a vet who doesn’t believe in the conspiracy, we will show how people who are systematically neglected find their reasoning in a theory that is completely unreasonable. We aimed at developing a film that, thanks to its highly relevant and universal theme, has a potential for international cinema, TV, and festival distribution. Since topics of ecology, preservation of nature, wolf protection, and isolated rural communities are currently trending in many European countries, we aimed to develop the film as a European co–production. Utilising that strategy, we increased the film’s visibility through international pitchings, workshops, and market attendance.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Triumphs of Modernism started with the development in September 2021. Our primary focus in development was finding archives, locations and partners outside of Croatia as well as securing financing for the shoot, which we confiremd in December 2021. Throughout the first half of 2022, we went on 8 location scouts in order to find relevant protagonists, sites, and other necessary material that enabled us to finish the scripts and prepare for the shoot. We participated at the Sunny Side of the Doc market in La Rochelle, which resulted in securing a sales agent (TVF International). We are very close to concluding the deal which will enable the series to reach an international audience. In addition, we visited one of the most important regional TV markets - NEM Dubrovnik in order to find pre-sales for the series. We managed to successfully shoot the series and deliver it to Croatian Radiotelevision in August 2023.\\\\n\\\\nThe development of European Union Wolf started with two training/pitching forums - Astra Film Lab 2021 and DocLisboa Nebulae 2021. Those two pitches were crucial in further refinement of the story arc and establishing the key female protagonist. Identifying the antipode to the main protagonist (Draja who represents the superstitious worldview) was the key to the increase of the dramatic potential of the story. He was found during the research shoot in February 2022. The project was further developed during three sessions of ExOriente training programme. The input received during the training followed by a final research shoot in September 2022 resulted in created assemblies for each of the film’s protagonists and understanding of their dramatic role in the final film.We have confirmed co-producers in Serbia, REZON Inkubator, with whom we have successfully applied and secured  funds of the Film Centre Serbia. Besides additional funding, this co-production is key to the easier access to distribution in Serbia.

Spanning diverse talents, perspectives, genres and budgets, the slate is unified by its exploration of socially pertinent issues. The Gut is a WW2 story told from a colonised, female and queer perspective. 2nd time writer-director Rebecca Cremona’s aim is to reclaim history by depicting real members of the marginalised entertainment communities whose contribution to the war effort has been largely forgotten. The Crusaders is a contemporary story of an American visiting the ‘Old World’, only to find a bitcoin culture and fractured society which he explores through a connection forged with an immigrant from Niger.  Directing duo Magdalena Zyzak (Poland) and Zachary Cotler (US) are in the unique position of telling this semi-autobiographical story. Moo is a universally appealing family film set in locally specific Gozo, centred around an 11-year old activist in the vein of Greta Thunberg. Written by multi-award winning environment economist Marie Briguglio, this important story is at once timeless and timely. Moondance, is a magic realist short by emerging writer director Ryan Gatt, which taps into Maltese traditions to spin a mythological story of a woman allergic to sunlight who is ostracised by her insular town.  Established in 2010, Kukumajsa is a pioneer of Malta’s fledgling indigenous film industry. We have Malta’s first ever Oscar submission under our belt, as well as a DGA and EMMY awarded short; we've collaborated with companies from high audiovisual capacity countries in above-the-line capacities and have produced one of few existing Maltese literature short film adaptations.

We know that by structuring meaningful financial plans to match the narrative scope and production values of each of these projects, we have an opportunity to build a creative and production hub in the CEE region where the sum of the projects’ parts will lead to a much more influential whole.\\\\nIn this application we have a German-Hungarian drama, BALATON BRIGADE, set entirely in Hungary. It’s built around topics and themes very common to the two countries, dissecting a painful, but also, from many respects joyous, era in our shared history. \\\\nWAR OF SAINTS is a very different proposition. It’s set entirely in Italy, depicting a narrative that is thoroughly Italian, but the chief creator is Hungarian. With the religious conflict arising in a small, much suffering town of Santocielo, Eszter is reaching deep into her own unique experiences, doubts and emotions as a Hungarian once living in Italy, to tell a universal story of faith, love and sacrifice. \\\\nFor both projects we have found partners in the respective countries who appreciate and share our vision. These are all stories stemming from a Hungarian emotional core, but the strong reaction from our European partners and the victories at international pitching events indicate that they resonate well beyond our borders.\\\\nApplying for the slate funding we were hoping to be able to reach the next stage of development: involve other main creatives; and start the process of finding the actors who will turn the characters into real persons; and locations which transform the imaginary world into reality. With finding the unique identity, it becomes more easier to move on to the next, the most important stage of every series project: the actual realization.\\\\nThe other goal was to make the projects more attractive for potential financiers, broadcasters, and streaming platforms.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Balaton Brigade\\\\nDuring the past year we have been able to make a leap forward in terms of development. We created an international writer’s room with a highly talented writer from Germany joining the Hungarian team. \\\\nThis was preceded by a long search for a writer who not only shares our passion for the project but can meaningfully contribute with his or her experiences from the era. This careful research led us to Arne Kohlweyer, an author and screenwriter who was born behind the Iron Curtain himself and brought his own experiences to the writers room. \\\\nTogether with him and the original creators of the project we spent three months together in Budapest and ultimately managed to rewrite the pilot episode and write three more episodes, leading to 4 scripts out of the 8 in the first season. \\\\nThe development also involved engaging a historical consultant. The lead director, Ildikó Enyedi also joined the work and provided her own take on the writing. \\\\nParallel to this process, we managed to scout for and find a second director to the project from Germany. Lennart Ruff is a great addition to the creative team, bringing his outstanding expertise in helming high budget series to the table. His younger perspective and more commercial driven approach keep proving to be invaluable to complement Ildikó Enyedi’s more arthouse oriented style. \\\\nTogether they also started working on the casting. With the help of casting agent Anja Dihrberg, an arduous process began. We’ve managed to secure the interest of two top German acting talents, Ulrich Matthes and August Diehl. Their love for the project and the creative package ensured that they are committed to be on board.\\\\n\\\\nWar of Saints\\\\nWe were first and foremost focusing on the story development. We worked on the rewrite of the already existing material but also moved on with the story with writing the next episode. \\\\nWe conducted interviews with different director candidates until we find the one who seemed the most adequate fit to the project.  After that, we could start the casting process – first with the scouting of talents, then narrowing them down to the ones who seemed to fit the director’s and the creator’s ideas about the specific characters. We also realized it is necessary to translate the scripts into Italian – the actual shooting language of the series -to help the work of our Italian partners.\\\\nLocation scouting: the story actually leaves some space for exploration: the only thing we knew for sure was that it must be shot in South-Italy.\\\\nAfter considering the different options, we’ve chosen the region of Puglia as the ideal location. We reached out to the Apuglia Film Fund who were enthusiastic about the project and offered access to their database. With their help we managed to narrow down the search to the province of Foggia, in the Puglia region, where we can find all our necessary locations.\",\"finalResults\":\"Balaton Brigade: The parallel processes described above have led to a strong, international quality package that our partners, Newen Connect and Flare Entertainment have been able to use to drum up interest in the project by the major players. As we took out the project to the market, in the first half of the year seismic changes shook the global industry. With the shares of Netflix plummeting and the Discovery-Warner Media merger decimating the original programming efforts at HBO Max in Europe, the outlook for high end drama series especially in the low production capacity countries in the CEE region does not look so rosy. However, the team behind the project continue to have strong faith in BALATON BRIGADE, so we are moving on to pitching to traditional broadcasters and platforms. Our firm conviction is that it is only a matter of time until we find the right partner to greenlight this remarkable and truly unique drama series project.\\\\n\\\\nWar of Saints: We managed to move on with the story development by reworking the story of the season, rewriting the pilot episode and writing the second episode of the series. We also translated the pilot episode into Italian. We enlarged our creative team with attaching director Beniamino Catena. With Catena, we were able to start the casting process, which is a major advantage in such an early development stage, as actors can have a huge impact on the characters. Not to mention their influence on selling the project to a major television network. With finding the province in Foggia as our main shooting location, we can see now way more clearly practical aspects of the shooting, and we could come up with a more specific and realistic production budget.  In Apuglia Film Commission, we found an invaluable long-term partner, who can help us throughout the whole process. We worked out in more details our existing action plans, modified our target groups and strategies.\\\\nAt the end we were able to create a unified creative vision for War of Saints – which is key to be successful in the actual realization of the project.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-08-12\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-10-11\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052844', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052844/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '04BE85E3F0EB972D3B3782D2903DE6CA55FF69A8302B2EF89A54D8750E20A868', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:14.168+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-11-11T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['04BE85E3F0EB972D3B3782D2903DE6CA55FF69A8302B2EF89A54D8750E20A868'], 'objective': ['\"The main objective of “Atom Art Mini-Slate” is to expand the studio\\'s capacity by developing two projects - feature animated film “Born Happy” and animation series “Hello, Oscar!”. \\n\\nProject “Born Happy\"\" activities include managing the production process and working with co-production studios, as well as dialogue polishing, script translation, storyboarding, animatic development and market attendance.  “Hello, Oscar!” activities include script writing and editing, script translation, storyboard development, one animatic, character design and background design development and 3D object animation tests. \\n\\nThere are 14 people benefiting for both projects together - 8 will work in “Born Happy” and 12 will benefit in the project “Hello, Oskar!”.

The film project was pitched at CineLink Industry Days taking place during the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2022 where it received very positive feedback from industry representatives. The raising of financing was successfully done through bringing on board another co-production partner from Bulgaria and applications to the Film Centre of Serbia, HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) and Bulgarian National Film Centre and the joint application of all co-producers for EURIMAGES funding.\\\\nMinor adjustments and finetuning were made to the script of the film, which was already at the very advanced stage at the time of submission of the mini-slate application. In addition to that the location scouting trip took place resulting in a list of shooting locations. The casting process for both actors and creative team was carried out successfully resulting in an experienced and dedicated team ready for production of the film. \\\\n\\\\nFor the documentary “Nistru. The Irreversible Flow of Life” the main focus of the development stage was further script development as well as promotion of the film internationally. The research trip to Moldova took place in autumn 2021, and the next rounds of research trips was foreseen in February, May and September 2022. The schedule for research trips in 2022 was affected by the full-scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, heavily influencing life in the neighbouring Moldova. In February and March 2022 director and executive producer of the film were actively involved in helping Ukrainian refugees transiting Moldova. The further research trips with participation of the director and producer of the film took place in April and June 2022, and resulted in an updated version of the script. In 2022 the project was part of two important development workshops. The producer of the film participated in EURODOC 2022, which provided an excellent opportunity to receive feedback from the international documentary community, both the fellow filmmakers and industry representatives. During the last session of EURODOC in October 2022 the project was presented to a number of international industry representatives including broadcasters and film festivals, which showed very high interest in the project and also extended valuable feedback. In November 2022 the director of the film took part in IDFA Academy, which was an excellent opportunity to receive feedback both from industry professionals and other participants of the Academy. Following the feedback the decision was taken to change the storytelling approach of the film and to focus on telling the story through a couple of protagonists, instead of the collective protagonist. In 2023 the director continued to work on the new approach resulting in an updated script version with defined shooting locations and protagonists.  Given the changes in the script, the further applications for funding were put on hold but will recommence at the beginning of 2024. \\\\n\\\\nThe creative team of the documentary “Measuring the Sky” used the development process for research trips to Chile, USA and Italy working on securing the material with the main protagonist and casting the protagonists for secondary roles. The trips to the USA were focused on filming the main protagonist at his home and university in Seattle, filming the laboratory producing the camera for the observatory in Austin, Texas as well as interviews with top engineers at SpaceX, the company whose activities in space serve as the antagonism to the endeavours of the film\\\\u0027s main  protagonist and his colleagues. The research trips to Chile were focused on filming the observatory in anticipation of the camera, while in Italy the team followed the main protagonist to the annual congress of astronomers as well as to the Vatican Observatory and his meeting with Pope\\\\u0027s astronomer. \\\\nTo raise the financing for the film, funding applications were submitted to HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) attracting funding for development and production. The application for funding in Slovenia fail but by only a few points, so we will re-apply with an elaborated version of the project in September 2023.  The creative team also took part in the pitching forum at the When East Meets West in Trieste, Italy in January 2023 and received a lot of international interest.\",\"finalResults\":\"The support of Creative Europe MEDIA programme was instrumental in finalising the development stage of the the fiction film “Mama”. The film is now ready to go into production and the start of shooting is planned for October 2023, encompassing four shooting weeks and finalisation of the film in spring 2024. The project, which started as a collaboration between Croatia and Serbia is now a co-production of Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria. \\\\nThe cast comes from Serbia with Croatia bringing in talent for 3 side roles. The majority of the creative crew comes from Serbia, with Bulgaria bringing in talent for the sound and make-up department, and Croatia contributing with producer and executive producer roles. The funding of the film has been secured by national funding sources - Film Centre of Serbia, HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) and Bulgarian National Film Centre and EURIMAGES funding. \\\\n\\\\nFor the documentary “Nistru. The Irreversible Flow of Life” Creative Europe MEDIA support was channeled towards further story development and research, and the main result of the project was shift in the focus from telling the story with a collective protagonist to a few selected strong protagonists and updated script. The project is currently in the final stages of the development and we plan to start the principal photography in January 2024. We plan to finetune the script and move forward with applications for funding in co-production countries - Latvia, Croatia, Finland and Moldova in 2024 as well as applications for international funds, including DOHA Film Institute for post-production. We have been invited to the pitching forum of Visions du Reel but turned it down since we felt the project is not ready yet. Now we feel that in 2024 we could take our chance to present the new version of the film to the international audience. \\\\n\\\\nThanks to the support of Creative Europe MEDIA programs documentary “Measuring the Sky” has achieved considerable development progress both in terms of casting of protagonists, gaining access and development of the storyline. The one aspect holding us back from going into production full scale is postponing the central event of the film - delivery and launch of high-resolution camera from the USA to the observatory in Chile. It has been delayed twice, due to Covid-19 restrictions and unrest in Chile. Now the deadline for delivery has been postponed to the end of 2024, and we have adjusted our production schedule accordingly. The changes in the production schedule, however, has given us more time to raise the funding needed for the production stage and we will use this delay to our benefit.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-09-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-08-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052837', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052837/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': '\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': '\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'AB0DA9E0F53271DE52C572742FD19523D907D986D280DA93F6F4EBAD5BA74DBF', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:12.732+0200'], 'endDate': ['2025-05-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['AB0DA9E0F53271DE52C572742FD19523D907D986D280DA93F6F4EBAD5BA74DBF'], 'objective': ['RFF has a 25 year track record in the auteur film industry and is currently ramping up their productions after a series of pan-European successes.

The funding has shielded the company from external pressures, coming from political influences as well as economic ones caused by new market entrants. This has allowed us to remain independent and continue the company\\\\u0027s idea to develop projects that are diverse and inclusive, while supporting who are sensitive to contemporary issues and courageously express them, exploring new genres.\\\\n\\\\nSupport from MEDIA facilitated the inclusion of new development executive (Kaja Jałocha) into our team. This strategic move amplified the company\\\\u0027s competitiveness and allowed us to sustain a growing slate of projects. The Slate-supported resources have facilitated simultaneous development and production of both projects that were initially included in the proposal, propelling \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" to its 2024 shooting schedule and expecting the script finalization and financing/production package closure of \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE\\\\\" by the end of 2023.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In the context of \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE,\\\\\" a series of strategic actions have been undertaken, significantly contributing to the project\\\\u0027s progress. On a script development level, we engaged with Torino Film Lab and held consultations with Nadja Dumouchel during the Mastercard Off Camera festival (Krakow 2022). This collaboration helped us to gain international perspective on the project and its content matter. \\\\n\\\\nRegular script meetings were systematically held under the guidance of the Development Executive (Kaja Jalocha). These meetings focused on character development, genre specifics, thematic depth, and dramaturgical structure. This led to 8 drafts of the script, reflecting the project\\\\u0027s evolutionary process. Exploring scripts thematic relevance, political consultations were conducted with Member of Parliament Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, offering insights into contemporary sociopolitical aspects of Poland. \\\\n\\\\nA moodbook, which encapsulates the project\\\\u0027s visual and emotional tone, was prepared. Collaborative dialogues were established with essential partners: distributors, sales agents, and streaming platforms such as Netflix and Canal+, to strategize the project\\\\u0027s dissemination. The project\\\\u0027s significance extended due to inclusion in industry catalogs, namely Poles in Cannes and Poles in Berlin, enhancing its global visibility. The interest of potential director – Anna Kazejak – was also secured (LOI).\\\\n\\\\nThe developmental progression of \\\\\"SARA\\\\u0027S BUNGALOW\\\\\" included two versions of the treatment and four script drafts. A comprehensive moodbook containing visual and location references was assembled to establish the film\\\\u0027s thematic essence. Specialist script consultants, namely Aleksandra Świerk and Kaja Jałocha, were engaged to analyze and advise on the subsequent drafts. Further expertise was sought from Maggie Soboil, an American script consultant, who conducted tailored workshops with the director and screenwriter, concentrating on the emotional character development.\\\\n\\\\nThe selection of cinematographer was a strategic step. The process culminated in the shortlisting of following DoPs: Kate McCullough, Monika Lenczewska, and Mikołaj Syguda, with the latter chosen to be the DoP of the project. The production\\\\u0027s financial structure was prepared (finance plan, recoupment), detailed production budget was created with the input of a production manager, and a comprehensive shooting schedule was generated by a second assistant director based on the fourth draft of the script. \\\\n\\\\nDevelopment process involved an extensive casting process to identify the lead roles, resulting in the selection of Agata Kulesza as SARA and Dobromir Dymecki as INKAR. Another significant milestone was the production of a test scene, featuring the chosen lead actors, which effectively conveyed the narrative\\\\u0027s essence through a video mood trailer. Project’s relevance was confirmed by the international exposure through its participation in prominent European film industry events, including the EFM in Berlin, Eastern Promises Karlovy Vary (online format), and Galway Film Fleadh Market in Ireland (online format). SARAS BUNGALOW received Polish Film Instutite production grant and is scheduled to be shoot in spring 2024.\",\"finalResults\":\"The company aimed to fortify its foothold in the European market by channeling its resources towards strategic areas of script development and nurturing emerging talents.\\\\n\\\\nThrough the support of the Media Slate, SHIPSBOY has not only realized its core objectives but also transformed them into tangible achievements. The infusion of resources and support facilitated the parallel advancement of \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" and \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE,\\\\\" defying initial limitations. The financing of \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" was successfully secured, with a slated shooting schedule set for the upcoming spring of 2024. The bolstered team, now including a dedicated Development Executive, has augmented the company\\\\u0027s competitiveness and nurtured an expanding network of talents.

It requires the removal of small regions of suspect tissues (biopsies) that are later sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). However, histology suffers from major weaknesses: First the standard HE protocol cannot work in vivo and requires ex vivo biopsies. Second HE is labour intensive, time consuming and the final tissue sections inspection is possible only after 12 hours. A faster but less accurate protocol, known as extemporaneous histology, can be performed in 40 min and is used in an intra-operative context to guide surgeries. The SpeckleCARS project aims to develop for the first time fast label free tomography microscopy with vibrational sensitivity to provide images with tridimensional improvement as compared to extemporaneous histology and in near-perfect concordance with conventional stained HE histology. This pioneering approach overcomes all the previous challenges: Using a wide field reflection scheme and label free contrast rules out all the drawbacks due to tissue removal and external labelling. It provides instantaneous intraoperative 3D histological data, improving the accessibility and accuracy of tumour detection, diagnosis and treatment. Combining the latest advances in 3D tomography reconstruction algorithms, high power laser systems together with key innovations in random speckle illumination and hyperspectral vibrational imaging, the SpeckleCARS project will provide for the first time volumetric histology imaging in real time over large (mm) fields of view without the need of tissue removal. To demonstrate the power of the developed technologies both ex vivo human and in vivo mouse cancer assessments will be conducted in collaboration with pathologists. The SpeckleCARS approach is broadly applicable to all cancer types and to any tissue diagnostic requiring histological data, so the project breakthroughs will benefit many medical and biology

festival's values peace, tolerance, human dignity and freedom of expression to continue promoting high quality European films. By bringing together festival-goers, filmmakers and industry representatives in numerous events and facilitating exchanges on art and social issues, we particularly strive to shine a light on underrepresented points of view. The festival's young and committed audience consistently engages enthusiastically in in-depth film discussions, masterclasses and round-table discussions. \\nThe film selection emphasises the artistic quality of films and the personal and creative approach of filmmakers. A total of six competitions and various out-of-competition programmes are on offer. In addition to classic film formats, interactive works exploring the new possibilities of virtual storytelling can also be discovered at DOK Leipzig.\\nWe intend to continue making use of these outlets and complement the on-site programme by recording film talks, giving filmmakers the opportunity to create short videos for use on social media, and promoting the festival extensively on digital media.\\nAlthough the conditions for cultural events in the near future are still uncertain, our planning is based on the assumption that we will again be able to welcome industry representatives, filmmakers and cinema-goers on site in 2021 and 2022. The offer in Leipzig's cinemas and venues will nevertheless be supplemented by a two-week streaming festival following the physical event. We expect around 48,000 visitors and a good 1,800 accredited guests per festival edition. \\nAs an international festival with a strong reputation, DOK Leipzig is committed to the principles of gender parity, inclusion, diversity and sustainability. While we have taken numerous steps to implement these principles in the past, we continue to work towards improvement in all of these areas.\\n\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Animation'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101052936'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['126000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":949226481,\"legalName\":\"LEIPZIGER DOK-FILMWOCHEN GMBH\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"04109\",\"street\":\"KATHARINENSTRASSE 17\",\"city\":\"Leipzig\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.3424395\",\"longitude\":\"12.374308\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"126000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['DOK Leipzig 2021-2022'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:22.951+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052936/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052936/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['126000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-09T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:22.835+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101052936'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101052936_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"DOK Leipzig is one of the leading festivals for artistic documentary and animated films in Germany as well as in Europe and with its more than 65-year history the oldest in the world. After a festival edition without any filmmakers and festival guests present on site in 2020, we were fortunately able to hold our 64th and 65th festival editions again mainly as in-person events in Leipzig. Turning the focus back to on-site events has been our response to the need for direct exchanges among visitors and industry professionals – a decision which was very well received by our audience and the accredited guests. DOK Leipzig proved to be an important event for the film industry despite the still ongoing pandemic.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"DOK Leipzig 2021\\\\n\\\\nFrom 25 to 31 October 2021, we presented 172 films and XR experiences from 55 countries, as well as numerous talks and panels. All films were screened in 11 selected Leipzig venues in compliance with hygiene regulations. A selection of 72 festival films was available online throughout Germany in the “DOK Stream” for 14 days following the festival week.\\\\nDOK Industry for the first time took place in hybrid form, with many events being held simultaneously online and in Leipzig. Around 1,400 accredited professionals took advantage of networking and education opportunities, including around 500 online participants from many countries around the world. \\\\n\\\\nDOK Leipzig 2022\\\\n\\\\nOur 65th festival edition took place from 17 to 23 October 2022 – once again mainly in local cinemas and venues. We presented 255 films and XR experiences from 55 countries as well as film talks and master classes in 11 Leipzig venues. \\\\nHowever, some of our online features continued, but in a reduced format. Those included livestreams and recorded film talks, as well as our VOD programme “DOK Stream”. This year, we focused on award-winning films and made 11 films available online throughout Germany for 7 days following the festival week.\\\\nDOK Industry also returned to a focus on in-person participation, with live streams, recordings and podcasts also providing online access to the programme for those who couldn’t attend in person. 1,471 international industry representatives met in Leipzig, with a further 210 accredited participants attending remotely. On two days after the end of the festival, accredited professionals had a further opportunity to network online. In total, DOK Industry recorded around 8,425 attendances this year.\\\\n\\\\nEuropean films presented by DOK Leipzig \\\\n\\\\nThe European film programming is an integral part of DOK Leipzig. Due to the festival\\\\u0027s long history as a meeting place for Western and Eastern European film professionals, the percentage of European and European non-national films is constantly high.\\\\nIn 2021, we showed a total of 182 films (including the Summer Cinema screenings). 90 of them have been produced in non-national EU countries and 54 in Germany. 73 non-national films were originating in a MEDIA country with a low audio-visual production capacity.\\\\nIn 2022, we presented 255 films (including Summer Cinema and fundraiser screenings, excluding films that have already been screened in 2021). 132 of those have been produced in non-national EU countries and 73 in Germany. 21 non-national films were originating in a MEDIA country with a low audio-visual production capacity.\",\"finalResults\":\"In 2021, we recorded a total of 38,950 visitors on site and online. This is about 80 per cent of the 48,000 visitors recorded before the start of the pandemic or at the hybrid edition in 2020. However, it is important to note that the festival offerings of DOK Leipzig 2020 largely took place online and were perceived virtually. In 2021, by contrast, 16,957 visitors attended the festival on-site. Against the backdrop that the events could only be implemented with reduced seating capacity and access restrictions due to COVID-19, the fact that around 80 per cent of the available seats were filled is a pleasing result of the first on-site festival edition since the beginning of the pandemic. \\\\n\\\\nSome film programmes that had to be suspended due to the pandemic in 2020, could be realized in 2021, such as the Retrospective, the Matinee Saxon State Archive, the DEFA Matinee and the series “Modular \\\\u0026 Modified – Animation and Musique Concrète”. These programmes were received very well and nearly sold out. The screenings at the Leipzig Central Station were filled to capacity (870 visitors). The festival opening as well as the two award ceremonies could again take place as festive events in the cinemas and were very well attended. Due to the hygiene measures, we were able to offer max. 780 people the opportunity to visit DOK Neuland. The exhibition was filled to capacity. Some visitors spent three to four hours with the immersive and interactive works. The online exhibition on Viveport and YouTube was also very well received: 652 streams were recorded.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, a total of 41,523 festival attendances have been registered. Particularly satisfying was the interest shown in the events on site. 30,596 attendees were counted at the cinema screenings, talks and industry events as well as at the DOK Neuland exhibition.\\\\nThe Retrospective “The Female Documentarists of the GDR” as well as the two Matinees on related themes were very well received. The two Master Classes by Mila Turajlić and Špela Čadež also met with enthusiasm. The free screenings at the Leipzig Central Station were again in high demand (more than 1,000 visitors), as was our XR exhibition (more than 900 visitors). \\\\n\\\\nOur community continues to grow on all social media channels. In December 2022, DOK Leipzig had over 31,570 subscribers on Facebook, 12,250 followers on Twitter, 10.980 on Instagram and 850 on LinkedIn.\\\\nBoth editions of DOK Leipzig received strong interest from national and international journalists. In 2021, 118 media representatives were accredited, of which 97 attended the festival on site and 21 online. In 2022, 126 journalists have been accredited, most of them also attending on site (101 persons; 25 journalists attended online). \\\\n\\\\nNational coverage continued to be wide-ranging in both years. Daily German newspapers such as Tagesspiegel, taz, Neues Deutschland, Süddeutsche Zeitung, FAZ, and Die Zeit as well as several national film media, such as Blickpunkt Film, Filmdienst, Cargo and Film \\\\u0026 TV Kamera, reported on the festival. Regional newspapers also published numerous in-depth articles. The German news agencies spread articles that were picked up across Germany. Extensive TV and radio reports have been broadcasted and published online. Print and online reports appeared in. \\\\n\\\\nInternational trade media also covered the festival broadly with several articles published by Cineuropa, Screen, Business Doc Europe and in the 2021 launched film review website The Film Verdict. In addition, articles appeared on Mubi Notebook, Documentary Magazine, ray Filmmagazin, Realscreen, DEED News, Modern Times Review, East European Film Bulletin and Dokumentarni.net.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052945', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052945/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Cinéma Defacto -

Le Slate est composé, d\\\\u0027une part, de projets d\\\\u0027auteurs confirmés: TRANSAMAZONIA c\\\\u0027est le quatrième long-métrage de Pia Marais, UN CHAMP DE FRAIS POUR L\\\\u0027ÉTERNITÉ c\\\\u0027est le 4ème long-métrage de Alain Raoust.

Pour TRANSAMAZONIA, nous avons travaillé sur plusieurs fronts au cours de la période concernée. Nous avons : finalisé la version du scénario pour le tournage, finalisé le casting de Byrne, et sommes en phase de finalisation du financement. Ce travail a permis d\\\\u0027annoncer que la mise en production de Transamazonia a été approuvé par nous et nos partenaires pour mai 2023.\\\\n\\\\nII. En ce qui concerne UN CHAMP DE FRAISES POUR L’ÉTÉRNITÉ, nous avons décidé de reporter le tournage pour l’été 2023. L\\\\u0027un des principaux risques que nous avions identifié concernant le film était le calendrier serré de la distribution principale. Or, l’un des membres principaux du casting a dû se retirer du projet en raison d’un congé parental, ce qui nous a rendu impossible le calendrier précédément établi. \\\\n\\\\nEn parallèle, certaines subventions importantes sur lesquelles nous comptions n’ont pas été obtenues. Dans ces conditions, nous avons jugé préférable de reporter le tournage à l\\\\u0027année prochaine. \\\\n\\\\nNous avons ainsi réorienté le développement du projet et avons réussi à compléter deux des objectifs indiqués ci-dessus : Alain Raoust a livré une nouvelle version du scénario, que nous avons partagée avec MEDIA via la plateforme. De plus, les voyages de repérage qui ont eu lieu cet été nous ont permis d\\\\u0027établir le cahier des charges des lieux de tournage et d\\\\u0027entamer les discussions pour réserver ces lieux pour l\\\\u0027été prochain. \\\\n\\\\nIII. PÉPITE est le projet de notre Slate 2021 dont le développement est le moins avancé. Ces derniers mois, Cyril Houplain a été accueilli par la résidence d’écriture organisée par le Groupe Ouest, en Bretagne, où il a eu l’opportunité de travailler sur l’écriture du projet dans un cadre prestigieux et aux côtés d’autres auteurs de renom. Le projet poursuit donc son cours comme annoncé.\\\\n\\\\nIV. Finalement, pour PESCA et en ce qui concerne le financement, nous n\\\\u0027avons pas encore obtenu le montant souhaité qui nous permettrait de tourner dans des conditions optimales.

However, the electrochemical potentials of reaction partners are only comparable within one solvent. This is a consequence of the solvent specific standard states.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is a Grand Challenge to establish a Unified Redox Scale to compare electrochemical potentials in all media without extra-thermodynamic assumptions. To achieve this, we use an ‘ideal’ Ionic Liquid Salt Bridge setup to measure the Gibbs transfer energies between different solvents. The measured values, corrected for residual liquid junction potential contributions, will be used to directly connect potentials to the aqueous scale. This unifying solvent-independent scale will allow for knowledge-based comparison and selection of reagents for redox reactions in the next sections.\\n\\nReagents for deelectronation (removal of an e–) at high potential are scarcely available. Hence, we prepare perhalogenated radical cation salts that act as innocent Deelectronators (iD+) with high unified redox potentials. An iD+ converts a given neutral M to the ‘naked’ cation M+. iD+-salts are straightforwardly accessible and room-temperature stable materials. Conveniently, they are in part weighable in air. Combined with suitable non-reactive, weakly coordinating but polar innocent solvents and robust weakly coordinating anions, reactive cation salts are accessible.\\n\\nSuch reversible iD+-mediated redox-processes at high potential are appealing for electrosynthesis and -catalysis. To generate, study and apply these systems, we introduce a generally applicable innocent solvent family compatible with the high potential of iD+ and M+ – also with commercially available anions.

earth elements (REE) and transition and post-transition metals (TM) are essential to modern life, yet we know little about how they concentrate at Earth’s surface, especially on the seafloor, which holds vast reserves. The DEEP-SEE project will shift paradigms on marine metal deposits from chemical composition and resource inventories to a holistic view based on atomic-scale observations and modeling. This research will determine geochemical processes that give rise to some of the highest metal partitionings in supergene ores. First, crystal chemistry of 3+ REE in biogenic vs. authigenic sedimentary apatite is proposed as a new proxy for the paleoceanographic enrichment setting with the potential to become an indicator for future exploration sites. Second, crystal chemistry of 3+ REE will elucidate the scavenging history of Fe-Mn crusts and corresponding evolution of seawater REE as recorded in growth layers over millions of years. Third, investigation of the redox chemistry and mineralogy of Fe-Mn crusts and nodules will explain how the redox-sensitive metals Co, Ce, Tl, and Pt are enriched from 109 to 106 times relative to seawater. To date, these processes have been impossible to interrogate because of analytical challenges posed by the multi-elemental composition and mineralogical heterogeneity of seafloor deposits. A promising approach for tackling these challenges is new micro-X-ray emission spectroscopy using a unique high-luminosity compact XES spectrometer at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Installation of the spectrometer on a microfocus beamline under construction on the new 4th generation ESRF X-ray source will provide a momentous gain of at least 100 in detection limit and unprecedented sensitivity and precision in the analysis of REE and TM. More broadly, the research will show how new knowledge about Earth processes can be obtained with a fresh look at individual trace elements previously inaccessible by crystal chemical study.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052913'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2370431.25'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999484121,\"legalName\":\"EUROPEAN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITY\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"38000\",\"street\":\"71 AVENUE DES MARTYRS\",\"city\":\"Grenoble\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.2076786\",\"longitude\":\"5.6922896\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"1815518.5\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":985804405,\"legalName\":\"ECOLE NORMALE SUPERIEURE DE LYON\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"69342\",\"street\":\"PARVIS RENE DESCARTES 15\",\"city\":\"Lyon\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.7332169\",\"longitude\":\"4.833241874137024\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"512500\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"thirdParty\",\"pic\":999997930,\"legalName\":\"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75794\",\"street\":\"RUE MICHEL ANGE 3\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8476256\",\"longitude\":\"2.2640027\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"42412.5\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['DEEP-SEE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

Offering a high-quality line-up of carefully selected films, Curtas Vila do Conde promotes the discovery of new films and filmmakers but also honours the heritage of Cinema. With its competition programs (International, Portuguese, Children, Experimental, Music Videos and Students) for fiction, documentary and animation and its side programmes (Special Programmes, Film-concerts, Exhibitions, educational activities and industry events), Curtas presents, every year, around 200 European films, after a process with over 5000 submissions for its competitions. Apart from competitions, the festival was held around its core sections and activities, either in its venues or online (streaming, webinars, debates): from Short To Features, premiere of new films; In Focus and New Voices, retrospective programs with films and masterclasses; Cinema revisited; Video Library; Debates, masterclasses and educational activities; Curtas Pro, the industry-related activities programme; Exhibitions. With well-balanced programming, aiming at independent and innovative short and feature films, the festival aims to provide a platform for film lovers, filmmakers, professionals and programmers. 9 days as a meeting point for a large number of film fans and more than 350 professionals – filmmakers and other artistic talents, curators and programmers, distributors, critics, academics, etc. – where MEDIA support allows to achieve the aforementioned objectives. We expect every year the presence of 150 filmmakers, producers and other talents related to films, 80 programmers and buyers, 60 critics and journalists, in a total of more than 400 professionals invited. Produced by a qualified team of more than 10 full time jobs, 20 seasonal jobs and over 100 volunteers, the Festival aims at all target audiences, from children and families to general audiences, presenting films to an overall audience of 40.000, including a large number of year-long activities. Every year we work and program the festival to increase the number of screenings, the overall audience and the promotion of European cinema with a special attention to first-time visitors and younger audiences, proposing a diversified and all inclusive program that might attract new target audiences which are not the core of film festivals. This is followed by a careful program to enlarge film education activities, especially those dedicated to young children and teenagers, based on our experienced permanent education service running all year, and to increase the participation of students with dedicated actions inside the program.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The 29th edition of Curtas, 16th and 25th of July, was challenging due to COVID pandemic. This edition has obtained an excellent response from the public, both in terms of adherence and compliance with safety recommendations, exceeding the best expectations. Besides the competition program (International Competition, National Competition, Experimental Competition, Music Videos Competition, Curtinhas and Take One Competition) the festival was highlighted by the In Focus section dedicated to Lynne Ramsay. Solar – Galeria de Arte Cinemática presented a solo exhibition by Portuguese director Diogo Costa Amarante “Be Your Selfie”, who won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 2017. Curtas Vila do Conde 2021 outcomes: 83 screenings, with 245 films in the program and 46 countries represented. 308 accredited professionals (directors, producers, actors, curators, distributors, press) participated in several industry activities. 2 film-concerts, 10 debates and presentations, 1 exhibition.

The available seats in the two venues of the Theatre, respecting the rules in force for cultural events, were reduced to 50%. The festival screened all films from the National Competition in Cinema Trindade (Porto) and Cinema Ideal (Lisbon). Curtas has made its program available on an online platform to compensate for the audience numbers due to the pandemic, but also to expand the possibility of participating in the festival, for those who could not or did not feel safe in visiting the event in Vila do Conde. Online viewing of each film was limited to 524 seats (the original number of seats in our main room), and no more than 15 days. Each film was made available the day after its screening in Vila do Conde, thus guaranteeing its premiere in Theaters. Substantial changes in 2021 with positive impacts: make the films of the festival program available online; reaching a broader audience and introducing new ways of communicate European cinema; using new technology and digital communication tools; extended the national competition sessions to other cities such as Porto and Lisbon at the same time of the festival, reaching new audiences; 9 talks with directors streaming live on Facebook.\\\\nThe 30th Curtas Vila do Conde in 2022 - 9th to 17th July 2022 -, marked by the end of covid-19 related restrictions took its original form with a few changes that impacted a broader audience, such as the online streaming of special sessions and debates. The celebration of the festival in 30 different locations was an opportunity to create a positive impact in local communities, bringing them closer to cultural activities and cinema. The very successful traveling cinema by the “Inflatable cinema” where we programmed a special selection of short films for children, families and young people living in Vila do Conde parishes surpassed our expectations in terms of outcomes, impacting 448 visitors in 8 different villages in a total of 24 sessions. Substantially changes on the festival website - responsive on all devices; adapting to online platform for festival management - Filmchief; online streaming of 11 sessions, including talks and debates during the festival; celebrating the festival in 30 different locations, bringing European cinema, audiovisual works, concerts and exhibitions traveling to uncommon places reaching new audiences - children and families.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052998', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052998/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '08D5C232D4F4E3F7ED159B61B5FBB679387C375925E7EF49900D79E80D2808D7', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:28.009+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-07-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['08D5C232D4F4E3F7ED159B61B5FBB679387C375925E7EF49900D79E80D2808D7'], 'objective': ['Planning and property data are the key evidence base for how cities are understood, planned and developed, informing public perception, guiding investments, and shaping policy. Yet, little critical attention has been paid to planning and property data and their lifecycles, circulation, politics, power and use in policy and stakeholder decision-making. This lacuna raises two important challenges that require redress if the validity of analysis, interpretation and decision-making is to be improved. First, transforming the ontological and epistemological understanding of planning and property data amongst those that utilise them. Second, fostering a reflexive approach to data politics and power in organisations that produce, share and use planning and property data. DATASTORIES will tackle these challenges by conducting research in a creative, highly engaged way with key stakeholders across three domains (state, business, NGOs/civil society). It will develop an innovative methodological approach that blends social science and research-creation methods, working with creative writers and artists, to map an entire data ecosystem (Dublin, Ireland), unpack data assemblages and produce a variety of data stories. 12 in-depth case studies will produce 36 data stories about and with planning and property data. The project will produce four key advances: new knowledge about the evidence-base for planning and property and its use; critical insight into the politics and praxes of data; novel research-creation methods and an assessment of their efficacy; and an extended conception of data stories and an understanding of their production and utility for different audiences.

Why are some visual stimuli consciously perceived, whereas others remain subliminal? What is the relation between conscious perception, attention and working memory? Recent work of my lab demonstrated that weak but simple stimuli can be reported once they elicit a minimal level of activity in the frontal cortex, which is related to the storage of the stimulus in working memory. For these simple stimuli, the visual cortex acts as a relay station that needs to pass the information to higher cortical areas. However, we found that the perception of more complex visual stimuli relies on a more sustained interaction between visual cortex and associative brain regions, related to scene segmentation and visual attention. These recent results pave the way for a genuine understanding of mechanisms for consciousness, inspiring new paradigms that assess the awareness of stimuli while varying the demands on attention and working memory. The present proposal will be the first to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across most brain regions. We will measure the activity of single neurons in human patients who are implanted with electrodes as part of their treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We will also use a new method that permits the recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will use perturbation methods at numerous locations throughout the brain in combination with functional imaging in monkeys to measure a “functional connectome” and to investigate the brain regions in which activity does (or does not) readily lead to a reportable experience.

The field has rapidly moved towards end-to-end neural approaches which aim to directly solve the machine learning problem for raw acoustic signals but often only loosely taking into account the nature and structure of the processed data. The main consequences are that the models are 1) overly complex, require massive amounts of data to be trained and extreme computing power to be efficient (in terms of task performance), and 2) remain largely unexplainable and non-interpretable.

Also in 2021, the 67th International Short Film Festival Oberhausen went exclusively online, due to the pandemic. The 68th International Short Film Festival Oberhausen took place in May 2022 as a hybrid festival on the web and on site in Oberhausen. \\\\nOberhausen is the ideal platform to promote and find new films and talents from Europe and all over the world. About 7,500 films are expected to be submitted for every edition. In the future, in addition to the on-site event, extensive dialogical offerings are to be created year-round in the digital space to complement offerings in Oberhausen that are limited in terms of space and time. Oberhausen offers a wide range of different programmes, such as competitions, thematic programmes, children and youth programmes on-site and online. Panel discussions, industry meetings, film education workshops, events for the general public, and satellite events outside the Festival completes the programme.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The main objects for Oberhausen are: \\\\nPromotion of European (non-national) films \\\\nExpand environmental friendliness \\\\nIncreased Digital Communication \\\\nRecovery from the pandemic crisis \\\\n\\\\n2021\\\\nAt ten days, the second online edition of the Short Film Festival was twice as long as usual. In eight competitions, three of them new, the festival awarded prizes worth nearly 52,000 euros, more than ever before. The Short Film Festival reached audiences in 75 countries; almost 1,400 festival passes were sold, significantly less than in 2020 when the first online edition of a film festival was held in Germany. Over 1,000 trade visitors were accredited; moreover, more than 200 people used the THIS IS SHORT pass of the European Short Film Network to watch films at the Short Film Festival. All in all, the Short Film Festival registered around 2,600 visitors and almost 60,000 viewings of the roughly 400 films in the programme.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 seven competitions, the 68th festival showed 163 current short film productions competing for prizes worth a total of 48,250 euros. The major thematic programme, planned also for 2021, \\\\\"Synchronise! Pan-African Film Networks\\\\\" examined the special production processes on the African continent, the entrepreneurial and artistic ingenuity born of difficult conditions, which can also be groundbreaking for Western countries. In six shows of works, the Short Film Festival presents legendary filmmakers and those yet to be discovered: Morgan Fisher (USA), Sohrab Hura (India), Rainer Komers (Germany), Shalimar Preuss (France), Sylvia Schedelbauer (Germany/Japan) and Eszter Szabó (Hungary). The festival celebrated its return to cinema with a series of programmes combining cinema with live elements, including the Conditional Cinema or Celluloid Expanded series. A special country focus was dedicated to the film country Lithuania. Music videos, children\\\\u0027s films, historical films and many others were also on the festival programme.\",\"finalResults\":\"The continuing importance of the Short Film Festival as one of the most important international platforms for the short form is shown by the approximately 800 accreditations or visits from over 70 countries and the extremely positive feedback from international festival guests and audiences, who after two online editions once again had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and see short films on the big screen. Receptions such as the 20th anniversary of AG Kurzfilm or the Lithuanian Embassy certainly contributed to this. The many opportunities to meet at the festival were requested in a friendly and relieved manner.\\\\n\\\\nWithin three years, the Short Film Festival has developed considerably technologically and strategically and is on its way to becoming a film festival that is no longer limited to place and time. This opens up the possibility of reaching audiences that could never have been reached locally in Oberhausen, far beyond national borders, through a new kind of structure.\\\\n\\\\nAll international events will probably continue to attract considerably lower audiences on site for quite some time due to the pandemic and above all the climate crisis, including the Short Film Festival; in all likelihood, it will be difficult to achieve audience figures like in the past. The first local festival edition is certainly not a meaningful indicator for the future, but it confirms the not-very-optimistic forecast from the previous year. It was all the more important not to cancel the festival twice in a row, but to use the pandemic as momentum for structural change and as a sign of the festival\\\\u0027s innovative strength, and above all to keep the network and contacts active.\\\\nThere is no question that a considerable number of outstanding short films are still being made and that they also need a platform; this can already be seen in the undiminished number of competition submissions compared to 2019. However, after the pandemic, with the climate crisis and in some cases considerable economic restrictions, completely new questions arise as to how a film festival can contribute to bringing films and audiences together, or in what ways this should happen in the future.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-02-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-01-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052997', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'C9C744C7EF7FB8563BD245F761C76A321B0A0B27F2F26A91364D41C3C86B1C77', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.677+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['C9C744C7EF7FB8563BD245F761C76A321B0A0B27F2F26A91364D41C3C86B1C77'], 'objective': ['This project aims to the development of communication at the nanoscale and to advance in the understanding of how abiotic micro/nanoparticles can communicate between them and how micro/nanoparticles can communicate with living systems. In this context, an approach for establishing communication at the nanometric level is to mimic how nature communicates. Chemical or molecular communication, based on transmitting and receiving information by means of molecules (chemical messengers) is one of the communication forms used by living organisms. Moreover, many swarm systems found in nature communicate by modifying the environment using a concept called stigmergy. The advantages of nanoparticles that communicate each to another are immediately obvious; they constitute the basis of a dynamically interacting network eventually resulting in certain autonomy of the system. If we would be able to raise the bases for communication between micro/nanoparticles and between micro/nanoparticles and cells, the potential future applications in the biomedical field, environmental research and industry technology are almost unlimited. The project will establish firm handholds for the use of nanoparticles able to communicate from one to another and with cells in different applications. The project will trace, optimise and adapt all single steps from the idea to its implementation into applicable final systems with the aim of targeting issues that are difficult to address with conventional single particles. The project is divided into three WPs. The first work package (WP1) will create the basic elements for chemical communication. In a more complex situation, WP2 will use the tools of WP1 to develop systems able to establish communication between nanoparticles and living systems. Finally, WP3 will generate nano-systems integrating gated nanoparticles and up-to-date electronics to develop new communication structures.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052997'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2499193'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999864846,\"legalName\":\"UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"46022\",\"street\":\"CAMINO DE VERA SN EDIFICIO 3A\",\"city\":\"Valencia\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"10.6535689\",\"longitude\":\"-61.1942361\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2458165\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"thirdParty\",\"pic\":997154957,\"legalName\":\"CONSORCIO CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION BIOMEDICA EN RED M.P.\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"28029\",\"street\":\"CALLE MONFORTE DE LEMOS 5\",\"city\":\"Madrid\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"40.4167047\",\"longitude\":\"-3.7035825\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"41028\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['EDISON'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.830+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2499193'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-09-09T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.804+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101052997'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2022-10-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052956', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052956/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'E899B3FEB4F63CF1E96EEB05F690A403B81D40985160B3D67F334FD49F70069F', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:24.714+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['E899B3FEB4F63CF1E96EEB05F690A403B81D40985160B3D67F334FD49F70069F'], 'objective': ['Beyond bifurcation, beyond instability, beyond even hyper-elasticity (!) there is an unexplored world of superior materials, capable of introducing a high-tech revolution and even influencing our daily lives. Surpassing bifurcation and instability yields unprecedented deformational capabilities and going beyond the concept of the elastic potential leads to materials capable of absorbing energy from the environment in a closed cycle of deformation and releasing it upon request. The road to this new paradigm is the fusion of the concepts of structural mechanics with the principles of solid mechanics, both brought to the highly nonlinear realm of extreme deformation. This opens virgin territory, left unexplored since the 100-years-old definition of the elastic potential, which has been treated until now as inviolable dogma. But structural engineers know structures capable of harvesting energy from the wind or becoming dynamically unstable when subject to follower loads, so that the implantation of these structural concepts in microscale form into a macroscopic solid leads to the creation of materials surpassing the concept of elastic potential and opening new horizons in the design of new materials. Our recent work exhibited that a purely elastic and conservative system can experience flutter instability. This strongly implies that an elastic solid can be devised that will exhibit this instability and violates hyper-elasticity. Implementing these concepts at the microscale (with elements generating microscopic interactions to suck/deliver energy from/to external sources) leads to architected materials which may harvest energy, or release it to move a mechanism, or propagate a signal with amplification, or suffer a Hopf bifurcation and self-oscillate at designed frequency.

A defining feature of these markets is that lenders give up goods today in exchange for a promise to receive goods in the future. Clearly, these promises are only valuable if they are expected to be honoured. We can think of promises as being backed by collateral, which – for the purpose of this proposal – I use as a generic term to denote the stream of future income that borrowers can credibly pledge. It is an economy’s stock of collateral that determines the amount and type of promises that can be traded, and thus the ability of financial markets to intermediate resources efficiently. \\n\\nIn past research, I have studied the key determinants and effects of an economy’s total stock of collateral. But there is a crucial aspect of the problem that deserves further study. In a world of heterogeneous agents, what matters for the allocative efficiency of financial markets is not just the overall stock of collateral, but also its distribution across firms, sectors and countries. Moreover, this distribution is largely endogenous, as it is shaped by general equilibrium forces and is bound to change when the economy does. In this proposal, I focus on three major ongoing shifts in the global economy and their effects on the distribution of collateral and the efficiency of financial markets: (i) declining interest rates; (ii) rising market power; and (iii) shifting distribution of power across countries. \\n\\n\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Macroeconomics', ' efficiency of financial markets', ' low interest rates', ' market power', ' hegemonic stability'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052964'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['1336250'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":998154445,\"legalName\":\"Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI)\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"08005\",\"street\":\"RAMON TRIAS FARGAS  25/27\",\"city\":\"Barcelona\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"41.38973205\",\"longitude\":\"2.190045333831681\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"1336250\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['MACROTRENDS_FINANCE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

The potential to conquer new audiences is substantial.\\\\n\\\\nThrough four levers, our global strategy aimed to bringing back spectators to our festival theaters, to rejuvenate and diversify our audiences, to sensitize them more particularly to non-national European cinema:\\\\n\\\\n1) Mediation during the festival: the purpose of accompanying film works is, on one hand, to offer  festival audiences a more intimate knowledge of non-national European works, and on the other hand, to reach new potential audiences.  \\\\n\\\\n2) Continuation and expansion of the numerous mechanisms for raising awareness, building audience loyalty and broadening the audience as a whole (mediation with targeted audiences...). \\\\n\\\\n3) Hybrid communication policy using traditional and digital tools, during the festival and throughout the year. \\\\n\\\\n4) Development of actions on “education to images” \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, in order to contribute to a better promotion and circulation of European cinema, Fema aimed to remobilize professionals by encouraging their participation, by developing partnerships, during the festival itself and throughout the year.\\\\n\\\\nFor all these actions, the festival wished to be part of a perspective both virtuous- parity-inclusive and environmentally friendly.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In 2021 and 2022, Fema offered an eclectic program, geographically and thematically diverse, demanding and balanced, around various sections with a large majority of European films: Tributes, Retrospectives, Discoveries, a section of 45 unreleased films and previews, a section of restored films…\\\\nIn 2022, the Festival La Rochelle Cinema celebrated its 50th edition with an expanded program and the welcoming of prestigious guests.\\\\nIn 2021, Fema screened 254 films (including 215 European films) during 383 screenings (334 during the festival and 49 after and “off-site/off-festival”). 18 European films were subtitled by Fema.\\\\nIn 2022, Fema screened 262 films (including 215 European films) during 364 screenings. 12 European films were subtitled by Fema.\\\\nIn 2021 and 2022, more than 120 screenings were presented and/or followed by Q\\\\u0026A sessions or debates. \\\\nFor each edition, many film lessons, music lessons as well as editing lessons, the “Rosselini Experience” in 2021, the “Pasolini Experience” in 2022 (films presented and commented by specialists of the Italian filmmakers\\\\u0027 works) were also programmed for the festival audience.\\\\nActions were implemented to promote accessibility to all audiences: audio-description, screenings open to specific audiences (sensory-disabled, psychiatric patients...).\\\\nNumerous events have marked these editions: cine-concert creations, concerts, exhibitions, special evening events...\\\\nIn parallel to the film program, Industry Days were held during this year’s edition, in particular to facilitate meetings between European creators and broadcasters (TV, film distributors, exhibitors...) around European works. \\\\nThroughout the year, the festival has implemented a series of actions (workshops, masterclasses, off-site/off-festival screenings) aimed at developing audiences and educating pupils and students to images, youngsters, local residents, inmates, hospital patients…\\\\nNumerous industry partnerships and collaborations have been set up, encouraging promotion and circulation of the works presented at Fema: programming agreements, co-productions, artist support, accessibility…\",\"finalResults\":\"After an unusual edition in 2021, the festival returned in 2022 to levels comparable to those of the pre-COVID editions.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all ticket, multi-entry-card and pass categories significantly increased between 2021 and 2022. \\\\n\\\\nSales of reduced-rate tickets and entry-cards (especially for under-25-year-old) increased a lot between 2021 and 2022 (+95% for 5-entry reduced-rate cards...). These indicators are encouraging and show, on one hand, that the festival is winning back its audience, and on the other hand, the success of its policy in terms of cultural and educational action throughout the year (which was reinforced in 2022), as well as the impact of the festival digital strategy. \\\\nThe organization of numerous off-site/off-festival events in the following winter has allowed us to continue the festival approach of broadening and renewing its audience. \\\\nAt the end of these editions, including the figures of the festival edition itself and those of the off-site/off-festival events throughout the year, we reach a total of 54 544 admissions in 2021, and 97,761 admissions (including 88,908 for the festival only) in 2022.\\\\n\\\\nInnovative actions, carried out on an experimental basis for target groups, have made it possible to develop accessibility to non-national European films: for example in 2021 and 2022, screenings of the new Original Version with Audio Subtitles process were presented to a group of visually-impaired festival-goers.\\\\n\\\\nThe industry professional attendance increased a lot between 2021 and 2022: we had a total of 1,262 accredited professionals (compared to 862 in 2021), including 55 industry professionals from outside France (39 in 2021) despite the resurgence of the epidemic in early July, notably from more than 10 MEDIA countries. \\\\n\\\\nMeetings were specifically organized for industry professionals. They were developed in 2022, allowing the reinforcement of mobilization. 20 organizations were involved in 12 meetings in 2022 (12 organizations in 6 meetings in 2021).\\\\nThe festival special sense of welcome and these industry-dedicated meetings have a real impact on promotion and subsequent circulation of films. A recent study confirms that 97% of exhibitors come to Fema to select films. And 55% of them are particularly interested in European films.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the festival period, the numerous programming agreements (with festivals, cinemathèques, distributors...) offer increased visibility to European films and encourage their subsequent circulation: purchase of rights (by TV channels as Arte, Ciné+), repeats, mutualization of costs (prints, subtitling, co-production of cine-concerts, common educational or marketing tools), editorialization, Blue-ray bonuses... \\\\n\\\\nAll-year-round activities on education to images, linked to the festival programming, which is mostly European, have made it possible to broaden the audience and had a very positive impact on the numerous participants, providing them with theoretical and practical knowledge and cultivating their spirit of curiosity. In 2021 and 2022, more than 5 000 festival-goers and more than 50 institutions and structures were concerned by these mediation actions, of which more than 600 youngsters were directly involved in the writing and directing workshops.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-04-19\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-04-18\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052965', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052965/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'F9D695B7E67CD7BA4165371EEA0872D135E6B99DABED41305EB30353BBEE3BF6', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:25.593+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-03-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101052965_10_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Accompagnement des projets en amont\",\"description\":\"Vidéos de présentation sur Festival Scope Pro\",\"code\":\"Demonstrator, pilot, prototype\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Activité: FIDLab 13e édition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-29\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4c9e4d/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_12_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"FIDLab à Cannes\",\"description\":\"Mailing FIDLab à Cannes\\\\nAgenda rendez-vous à Cannes\\\\nPhotos et vidéos\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Activité: FIDLab 13e édition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3e6ed4/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_14_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Promotion films finalisés\",\"description\":\"Newsletter\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3e8dbe/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_15_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Rapport d\\\\u0027activité de l\\\\u0027édition 2021\",\"description\":\"Rapport d’activité\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4cdf78/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_16_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Rapport mutualisation des dépenses\",\"description\":\"Rapport\\\\nmutualisation des\\\\ndépenses\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4bed4d/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_18_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Événement de dissémination\",\"description\":\"Dissémination\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-29\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3f36a5/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_5_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Communication et marketing\",\"description\":\"Newsletters;

Cette richesse offre aux projets sélectionnés une plus grande visibilité ainsi qu’un plus grand nombre d’opportunités de collaborations, de contacts et de soutiens. \\\\n\\\\nLes porteurs de projets et les professionnels apprécient le soin apporté à l\\\\u0027accueil des projets : 1. coaching individuel pour préparer la vidéo de présentation, 2. échanges afin d’établir les besoins des projets pour cibler les one-to-one. 3. matchmaking soigné afin de diriger les professionnels vers les projets de leur intérêt. Chacun se sent porté et enveloppé dans un écrin (cf article screendaily). \\\\n\\\\nMême si les rencontres virtuelles ne peuvent pas remplacer l\\\\u0027efficacité des rendez-vous présentiels à Marseille, l’édition en ligne est source de potentiels. En ce sens, l’équipe du FIDLab continuera à se nourrir des nouvelles compétences acquises et sera en mesure de proposer des innovations sur la forme de la prochaine édition, en 2022.\\\\n\\\\nLors de la tenue de l’édition 2021, 86 projets étaient finalisés sur les 143 sélectionnés depuis le lancement du FIDLab, en 2009 soit 60% des projets. D’ici la prochaine édition du FIDLab, 10 nouveaux films existeront ce qui portera à 70% le taux de projets devenu films.\\\\n\\\\nMême s’il est encore tôt pour les projets sélectionnées en 2021, un des projets à été finalisé et sélectionné en première mondiale à la Quinzaine des réalisateurs à Cannes : Une nuit sans savoir de Payal Kapadia. Le film a obtenu l’Oeil d’Or, prix du meilleur documentaire à Cannes et il a été projeté dans plus de 20 festivals dans le monde entier et le FIDLab a accompagné sa sortie en salles en France en avril 2022. Également sélectionné à Cannes 2021, le film Ghost Song de Nicolas Peduzzi a fait sa première à l’ouverture de l’ACID et le FIDLab a accompagné sa sortie en salles en avril 2022.\\\\n\\\\nEn 2021, 24 projets sélectionnés sur 28 étaient des projets européens avec notamment 16 projets de pays européens à plus faible capacité de production. Nous cherchons également à mettre en réseau des porteurs de projets extra-européens avec des coproducteurs européens. La participation de 4 sociétés de production dans le cadre du Focus Belgique, organisé en étroite collaboration avec 4 institutions clés dans la promotion du cinéma Belge, s’inscrit dans cet esprit. En devenant un espace de rencontres et de travail entre professionnels européens qui souhaitent se mettre au service de la découverte de talents et d’œuvres, le FIDLab démontre son ambition européenne. \\\\n\\\\nEn outre, la renommée internationale du FIDMarseille et du FIDLab, reconnus comme labels, permet de faire circuler et de rendre visible des projets européens à l\\\\u0027international. La communication ciblée du FIDLab, adressée à une liste de plus de 10.000 contacts professionnels internationaux, parmi lesquels des programmateurs de festivals majeurs, les vendeurs internationaux et les distributeurs, favorise la possibilité de circulation des projets présentés à l\\\\u0027échelle mondiale.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-04-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251589101053013', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251589/101053013/CERV', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'F1645CA253D0D2DE80E76B1E8F39DA606BCFEF16A18439D402E279A109FFBC1B', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CERV Operating Grants Framework Partnerships'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:30.821+0200'], 'endDate': ['2025-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['F1645CA253D0D2DE80E76B1E8F39DA606BCFEF16A18439D402E279A109FFBC1B'], 'objective': ['Dementia is the leading cause of disability and dependency in older adults.

Promote and defend the rights of people with dementia as full EU citizens and give them a voice in EU and national policies by involving the European Working Group of People with Dementia in all FPA activities\\n2. Promote the compliance of national dementia policies and strategies with UNCRPD and ESRPD principles by mapping and analysing national policies, identifying good practices and promoting dementia-inclusive policies and initiatives\\n3.  Improve the capacity of its national member organisations to contribute to national and EU disability policies by organising capacity building webinars and workshops\\n4. Ensure that dementia is recognised as a leading cause of disability and dependency by actively contributing to EU policy making and supporting the implementation of the ESRPD and Social Semester process\\n5.

PEOPLE  \\\\nIn year two, three types of new services were developed for the network members to support resilience, through the TEH Hub model development, with significant uptake by the end of 2023 and new projects emerging across many countries. 2 new hubs officially launched in 2023 - The Mediterranean Hub and Youth Hub. \\\\nThe outcomes of the wellbeing hours program provided TEH members with insight into the challenges cultural workers face, as well as methods for overcoming them. \\\\nLearning resources focused on diversity issues and tools usage, with upcoming courses planned for 2024 based on identified struggles from the centers, particularly anti-eviction efforts.\\\\nFive types of new services offered to the network members centres in the areas of well-being, financial structure, capacity building, resources exchange. \\\\nOur TEH Conference in Leipzig hosting over 270 participants, had a substantial impact on both the local and international levels. It featured an innovative, curated program which inspired other potential conference hosts within the network. \\\\nAt our annual camp meeting, 200 cultural professionals travelled to Tbilisi, Georgia, coming together to learn new skills in the field of collaborative work methods and co-ownership models. \\\\nFindings from program evaluation under this objective suggest members need support from both perspectives of operating a venue and the challenges presented through operating in the wider social, political and cultural landscape. \\\\n2. BUILDINGS  \\\\nSustainability remains a key focus for members, encompassing the physical structures of buildings, environmental impact, and the broader influence of organizations as placemakers in rural and urban contexts. The network\\\\u0027s strength lies in sharing knowledge, addressing risks, and finding solutions to issues like regeneration and gentrification highlighted by members. TEH activities support cultural sector leadership and act as a cultural and creative placemaker. Members actively seek cross-contextual knowledge through staff exchanges and camp meetings.\\\\nThe Sustainable Buildings Hub (SuBHub) has grown to 50 members across 16 countries, focusing on Peer-to-Peer knowledge exchange, identifying competencies, and planning a 2024 training program for technical aspects of sustainable building transitions. Year 3 will track further development. Our Sustainability Hub enhances members\\\\u0027 understanding of Green Deal goals, fostering sustainability and inspiring other. Through the membership program, staff exchange, learning resources, and biannual meetings, we contribute knowledge, capacity, and expertise to sustainable regeneration in both urban and rural areas. \\\\n\\\\n3. ART\\\\u0026CULTURE\\\\nThe Year one report highlighted a need to understand existing ways that members have collaborated to increase the understanding of the value of their work in their communities. This is an ongoing need, especially as members highlight the need to influence local decision making and advocacy with resources that can aid this conversation. As venues act as community builders, the value of this role arguably needs to be framed and communicated in a way that can influence local politics and social sustainability. Members face challenges to influence local politics given the day to day needs of running a cultural venue, with often a small team. This need potentially highlights a greater role for TEH to further develop support resources that aid advocacy of the role of independent cultural organisations at a local level. \\\\nThroughout 2023, the management team and board of Trans Europe Halles have visited cultural centres, third-party events, and high-level political gatherings to advocate for their members and the independent cultural sector at large within the frames of the city visits and advocacy visits activities. On a micro-level for example centres under threat of eviction have been supported and on a macro-level, TEH has engaged with the work of Cultural Action Europe, On the Move, Pearle, EIT, New European Bauhaus and other European advocacy organisations.

We expect more than 150 guests from France, Germany, Spain and Romania.\\n\\nWith respect for the twinning traditions, we approach Eurozoersel 22 with fresh eyes. We welcome old friends, but also new young participants. With these young people (aged 18 to 26 years) we start a first project in April-May 2022, a prequel for the town twinning event in August: we bring together a young delegation from our twinning towns, proportionate composed of boys and girls. We instruct this group of young people  to visualize their towns: together they have to make a short film that introduces us to their world, through their young eyes. By working together on this project, European young people get the opportunity to understand each other's world. We give four themes that they should visualize in their film. These are important topics for all our European partners, and will also be the four themes of the event in August:\\n1: Europe, democracy and citizen participation\\n2: climate and local sustainable economy\\n3: (youth) culture and cultural heritage\\n4 : well-being and inclusion\\nThe youth film will be used as a common thread during the event in August. The four themes are also reflected in joint activities, visits, workshops and final debate during the Eurozoersel event.\\n\\nAs the objective of Eurozoersel 22, we want to (1) have a rejuvenated and even stronger European partnership and (2) have established at least 4 (per theme at least 1) new concrete cooperation actions for the coming years with our European twinning towns.\\n\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['climate and local sustainable economie', ' (youth) culture and cultural heritage', ' well-being and social inclusion'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251589101053000'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CERV-2021-CITIZENS-TOWN-TT'], 'overallBudget': ['23255'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":909471419,\"legalName\":\"GEMEENTE ZOERSEL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"2980\",\"street\":\"HANDELSLEI 167\",\"city\":\"Zoersel\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"BE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Belgium\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.2707158\",\"longitude\":\"4.642835\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"23255\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":948359592,\"legalName\":\"Stadt Graefenhainichen\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"06773\",\"street\":\"Markt 1\",\"city\":\"Graefenhainichen\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.7322073\",\"longitude\":\"12.4592318\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":947899715,\"legalName\":\"Stadt Laubach\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"35321\",\"street\":\"Friedrichstrasse 11\",\"city\":\"Laubach\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.54082885\",\"longitude\":\"8.990854504162188\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":3,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":942840583,\"legalName\":\"AYUNTAMIENTO DE LORA DEL RIO\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"41440\",\"street\":\"PLAZA DE ESPANA\",\"city\":\"Lora Del Río\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"37.7034094\",\"longitude\":\"-5.497948870547946\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":4,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":938824201,\"legalName\":\"Comité de Jumelage d\\\\u0027Elancourt\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"78990\",\"street\":\"Square de la Canche 1\",\"city\":\"Elancourt\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.764641\",\"longitude\":\"1.956343\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":5,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":938820224,\"legalName\":\"Asociatia de Prietenie Crucea-Zoersel\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"727150\",\"street\":\"Str Principala, Crucea\",\"city\":\"Crucea-Suceava\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"RO\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Romania\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"47.3506059\",\"longitude\":\"25.6112767\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":6,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['EuroZoersel22'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

They include powerful tools from p-adic analysis,  isometries of CAT(0) cube complexes, pluripotential theory, and algebraic geometry. Simultaneously, recent arithmetic equidistribution theorems have been combined with holomorphic dynamics to solve problems of unlikely intersection in the dynamics of polynomial maps and to study parameter spaces of such maps.

IFFR celebrated its 50th edition in 2021 as an expanded hybrid multi-part festival from 1 to 7 February and from 2 to 6 June, with both festival parts connected by a dynamic series of physical and online events. The 51st edition will take place from 26 January to 6 February 2022, with an estimated 271,000 visits (COVID-19 regulations permitting) and over 2,000 industry professionals in attendance. The strategic objectives for the next 3 to 5 years, which will be detailed via organisation-wide workshops, are as follows. First, IFFR aspires to present broad and diverse cinema through a clear vision and a cohesive programme that is globally recognised as visionary, with a clear commitment to creating opportunities for filmmaking talent through numerous industry initiatives including co-production market CineMart and its Hubert Bals Fund. The audience reach will continue to be international, national and local; public, industry and education audiences shall be engaged, growing and diversifying. IFFR will make a positive difference to the cultural and social life of Rotterdam and beyond, with a global, national, and local impact on the film industry. IFFR also intends to consistently grow and deepen its partnerships and their contributions; with exemplary long-term relationships with the government, sponsors, partners and donors. Production-wise, through streamlined audience and filmmaker services, IFFR will offer optimal conditions to experience film on-site and online. Lastly, IFFR will be a sustainable, diverse and inclusive organisation with clear structures, robust planning, open communications and diversified revenue streams.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['festival', ' film festival', ' feature films', ' short films', ' audovisual work', ' virtual reality'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053058'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['150000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":946696430,\"legalName\":\"STICHTING INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ROTTERDAM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"3012 EJ\",\"street\":\"KRUISKADEHOF 36 B\",\"city\":\"Rotterdam\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.9218351\",\"longitude\":\"4.4746365\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"150000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['IFFR 2022-23'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:59.187+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053058/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053058/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['150000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-01-27T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:59.057+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053058'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-09-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053058_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"IFFR is a leading cultural platform accessible to all, that champions compelling cinema and audiovisual art. Through screenings, talks, exhibitions, and various networking opportunities, IFFR enables discovery, dialogue, learning and people coming together. We look where others don’t look, and through IFFR’s distinct programming, we open a space for ideas that captivate, engage and entertain, pushing creative boundaries that have the power to transform. IFFR supports independent storytellers and advances the impact of their work in the world.\\\\n\\\\nFFR creates opportunities for the independent filmmaking community from across the globe, to reach broad and diverse audiences. Through its visionary programming, year-round activities and forward-looking initiatives, it is a haven for the plurality of voices, audiovisual formats and storytelling, and an essential destination for film professionals and film lovers. IFFR seeks to challenge people’s views of the world and each other through film.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"For 2022, IFFR developed a programme, that due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, could not be brought to the audiences in the way it was intended. Due to a suddenly announced government enforced lockdown all cinemas were closed which forced IFFR to a last-minute switch online with a limited programme for 26 January - 6 February in 2022. This meant that none of the films (with the exception of one) could be shown on the big screen in the presence of filmmakers and audiences - which is very much the raison d\\\\u0027être of festivals including that of IFFR. However, with the online platform we’ve developed with three other Dutch film festivals, IFFR managed to pull this switch off in a short timespan and in compliance with the quality and safety standards we set out. We still reached a considerable amount of 117.267 visits during the online 2022 festival. \\\\n\\\\nThe opening film of IFFR 2022 was Amanda Kramer’s Please Baby Please. The closing film Dragon Inn by King Hu marked the opening of the 25 Encounters anniversary programme. On February 6 during the awards ceremony, Paz Encina won the Tiger Award for her feature EAMI. The special jury awards were awarded to Excess Will Save Us by Morgane Dziurla-Petit and To Love Again by Gao Linyang. \\\\n\\\\nThe results of an extensive audience experiences research show that even with IFFR taking place almost entirely online for the second year in a row, the audience still highly values the festival experience. They graded 2022’s festival experience with a 7.6 (2021: 7.7). Our audience was composed out of 20 different ethnicities, but the vast majority of the visitors held Dutch nationality. This is of course also indicative that there is still room for improvement. An interesting development is that IFFR has reached a larger audience outside the South Holland (Rotterdam) region with its online offering, with no less than 60% of the online audience coming from outside of the region.\\\\n\\\\nWe were able to present a strong selection not only to the audience, but also to Press \\\\u0026 Industry. The online Pro Daysstill provided networking opportunities and an attractive programming.CineMart returned, albeit online, with 656 one-on-one meetings. \\\\n\\\\nFollowing two online editions, IFFR 2023 was our first full in-person festival since the start of the pandemic. The film programme for audiences of our 52nd edition consisted of 455 films. Additionally, the Art Directions programme consisted of 6 art installations (including Steve McQueen’s Sunshine State, which was commissioned by IFFR), 7 performances, and 5 immersive media projects. The IFFR Talks programme also took place in-person again, with 15 talks and panels scheduled during the festival, most of which were made freely available online for audiences worldwide after the festival. A total of 91 countries were represented in the IFFR 2023 programme (a substantial growth compared to 2021 [66] and 2022 [61]). The Tiger Competition and Bright Future programme (both aimed at new talent), as well as the Short \\\\u0026 Mid-length programme, reached an almost 50/50 gender balance.\\\\n\\\\nThe openingfilm of IFFR 2023 was Munch by Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken and the closing film was All India Rank by Varun Grover. IFFR’s trademark Tiger Competition celebrates the innovative and adventurous spirit of up-and-coming filmmakers from all over the world. From 14 selected titles in 2023, Le spectre de Boko Haram by Cyrielle Raingou received the Tiger Award during the award ceremony on 2 February 2022. Munnel by Visakesa Chandrasekaram and New Strains by Artemis Shaw and Prashanth Kamalakanthan both won Special Jury Awards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIFFR looks back at its 52nd edition in 2023 with great satisfaction; the festival registered 283,506 visits – 8,871 of these visits were registered via the in 2020 created online streaming platform (in collaboration with IDFA, Cinekid and NFF), through which 25 films from our IFFR 2023 programme were made available to Dutch audiences. We have not yet reached our pre-pandemic visitor number of 340,000, but can conclude a good recovery compared to 2022 (180,637) and 2021 (271,105, two events in February and June).\\\\n\\\\nAudiences were equally satisfied with IFFR 2023. They rated the festival at a 7.9, which is higher than 2022 (7.6) and 2021 (7.7).\\\\n\\\\nIFFR Pro 2023 consisted of the following core activities: the co-production market CineMart, with the new addition of the IFFR Pro Darkroom, the talent development programmes Rotterdam Lab, BoostNL, Creative Producer Indaba, the think tank Reality Check and the Pro Hub. In essence, this means the support of filmmakers and creating visibility around their films, offering a platform for industry professionals to facilitate their network, one-to-one meetings, workshops and masterclasses, debate and conversation (IFFR Pro Dialogues). 2.510 insutry guests, 345 film makers and 680 Cinemart guests joint IFFR Pro in 2023.\",\"finalResults\":\"Thanks to Creative Media Europe, IFFR was capable of bringing a strong programme to audiences - either online or in person.

Every year it attracts more than 80,000 visitors and professionals from all over the world with the best and highest quality animations and interactive works to Stuttgart.\\nITFS is an Oscar-qualifying festival that offers directors, production and distribution companies, talents, and all other industry representatives from the fields of animation and games a platform to showcase their films, interactive and transmedia works as well as VR and AR projects to an interested broad audience and numerous representatives of the industry. At the heart of the festival are the competitions and film programmes at Innenstadtkinos. Every year up to 70,000 EUR in prize money are awarded by international juries of experts in twelve competition categories. The FMX - Conference on Animation, Effects, Games and Immersive Media and Animation Production Days (APD), the most important German co-production and financing market for animation, take place at the same time. Thanks to the special combination of film festival, trade congress and financing market, the events have developed into a unique\\nplatform for the financing and development of animation projects and attract up to 6,000 professional visitors to Stuttgart every year. ITFS 2020 and 2021 had to take place as online-only editions, reaching additional, new audiences in the process. But a festival like the ITFS is brought to live by personal, face-to face encounters. We are therefore planning a hybrid version for 2022 that combines cinema screenings and games exhibitions with digital applications and experiences in virtual space. The ITFS Festival editions are supplemented by various year long activities such as ITFS Animation Tour and ITFS Animation Special.\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053038'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['150000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":939039056,\"legalName\":\"FILM- UND MEDIENFESTIVAL GGMBH\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"70173\",\"street\":\"STEPHANSTRASSE 33\",\"city\":\"Stuttgart\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.7803263\",\"longitude\":\"9.1787405\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"150000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['ITFS'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.251+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053038/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053038/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['150000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-12T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.133+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053038'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053038_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"The Stuttgart International Festival of Animated Film (ITFS) is an Oscar-qualifying film festival with up to 100,000 visitors and among the largest and most important festivals for animated film in the world. Using the keyword Expanded Animation, ITFS pays special attention to the constant expansion of connections to other sectors of the cultural and creative industries such as games, VR, architecture, art, opera and theatre. Since ITFS was founded in 1982, the promotion of young filmmakers has been one of the festival\\\\u0027s main objectives and core competencies, especially with the Young Animation competition, university presentations and, increasingly, qualified training programmes. Over the past 15 years, the festival\\\\u0027s relevance to the industry has also been significantly expanded, for example by founding the Animation Production Days and organising the Trickstar Professional Awards. Alongside the specialised offerings for talents and professionals, ITFS primarily stands for low-threshold access for a broad regional audience, achieved with various programmes such as \\\\\"Tricks for Kids\\\\\" or \\\\\"Best of Animation\\\\\", feature film specials and the Open Air on Schlossplatz Stuttgart. Programmes such as the Country Focus, \\\\\"Animation Around Europe\\\\\" or \\\\\"In Persona\\\\\" underline the festival\\\\u0027s international relevance. The thematic series are important from a curatorial and conceptual point of view, contributing to the festival\\\\u0027s high reputation with the industry and the press. The 2021 and 2022 festival editions faced particular challenges due to the coronavirus crisis. The war in Ukraine since February 2022 has further complicated the situation for ITFS, in terms of finances and organisation as well as content. The objective and main concern was to provide an attractive and high-quality offering, for the online-only edition in 2021 as well as for the hybrid 2022 edition, geared towards the standards of previous festivals. In 2022, after two online editions, the aim was also to bring audiences and the industry back to Stuttgart and at the same time to use the digitalisation know-how developed since 2020 in the field of streaming and media libraries to develop a hybrid festival with an even stronger international impact, reaching new target groups and also audiences and professionals unable to attend due to existing lockdowns, health impairments or financial reasons.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Due to the lockdowns resulting from the coronavirus crisis, ITFS had to be almost fully reinvented in 2020 and 2021 and new digital offerings had to be developed. The experience with and from the Online Animation Library (since 2011) provided some expertise, but this had to be significantly expanded in 2020 and especially in 2021 and 2022 in view of entirely new needs and circumstances. While the transformation of ITFS 2020 into an online event had to be done at very short notice, the 2021 edition saw a digital professionalisation, resulting in the implementation of a broad, exciting and sophisticated online programme offer consisting of a media library, webinars with live Q\\\\u0026As, digital meeting rooms and networking opportunities, which was able to address the target groups of general public, talents and professionals comprehensively with different formats. The ITFS 2021 website was accessed 250,000 times from 3-16 May. Although ITFS 2021, initially planned as a hybrid event, again had to be realised online only due to the coronavirus situation, some filmmakers and producers were on site for the opening and the awards ceremonies, which were streamed in high quality; they were also available for live interviews and talks in the festival studio. To manage the digital offerings, a digital team was set up in 2021 and 2022, consisting of existing team members and new staff. This meant that there were no redundancies during the coronavirus period either. For ITFS 2022, which could take place on site, the big challenge was to largely maintain the digital offerings while holding the on-site festival in the usual size and as far as possible with the same scope of content as in 2019, which came close to staging two festivals in parallel. The adjustment of the space capacities (25% capacity), which was initially made due to regulations, could be cancelled for the festival. Decentralisation of the venues was maintained. The greatest achievement of the 2021 and 2022 festival editions was the continued commitment of the industry and the general public to the ITFS through attractive and adapted offerings and communication measures, while introducing them to new formats. These new offerings, such as the Online+ media libraries and the specially developed OnlinePro platform, were used intensively (2021: 46,000 views of animated short and long films). The accomplishment of 2022 was the extremely complex hybrid implementation of the festival.\",\"finalResults\":\"Despite great financial (many sponsors were very cautious because of the COVID-19 situation and the war in Ukraine) and organisational challenges, the 2021 and 2022 festivals were carried out successfully and many innovations were initiated. The ITFS was certainly one of the pioneer festivals in terms of digitalisation. In 2021, an international team of designers from France, Switzerland and the Netherlands developed the ITFS VR Hub, which invited audiences to meet other festival guests virtually as avatars. Real venues were imaginatively recreated, and individual digital festival zones set up. For 2022, ITFS received additional funding for the VR Hub from the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) so that this highly innovative area of multi-user experience could be expanded and managed by specialist staff. Workshops, film screenings and meetings took place in the VR Hub, just like at the on-site festival, and were mainly used by members of the public who could not attend in person. Professionals were offered specialised webinars by ITFS in 2021 and 2022. The media library was significantly developed from 2020 to 2022 and since 2022 has been implemented with service provider Pantaflix, allowing for even higher protection and better evaluation and usage options. While ITFS took place online only in 2021 and reached over 6,800 registered users (professionals and festival pass holders) and generated a total of 250,000 page views with the free stream and free offerings, in 2022 the audience turnout shifted towards the on-site festival, as intended.\\\\nResults 2022: Online media library 19,000 views, cinemas 20,000 viewers, Open Air 25,000 viewers. The online offerings reached many guests from abroad, including China which continued to be affected by lockdowns and travel restrictions. With the return of accredited guests to ITFS 2022, much exchange and discussion could be generated on site – especially in conjunction with APD and FMX. The 2021 and 2022 tour programmes realised after ITFS continued to contribute to a very good dissemination of the ITFS programme. The professional live streams of 2021 and 2022 were an important addition to the ITFS programme and conveyed a vivid image of the international and European animation scene by way of moderation and many interviews, strengthening the reputation of ITFS among the audience and the industry.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053041', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053041/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '9F1E1A0D2CCC0ED9103A9C226713312EB328E96EC13263542FA3D00ABB19A0F1', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.449+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['9F1E1A0D2CCC0ED9103A9C226713312EB328E96EC13263542FA3D00ABB19A0F1'], 'objective': ['The current slate of m-films has the objective to develop three projects, which include: \\n●\\tFiction feature films SLOW (in co-production with Netherlands and Greece); FAKE NEWS (in co-production with Italy and Latvia); and VISITOR (in co-production with Spain).\\n●\\tAnimation TV series BFF (in co-production with Poland). \\n●\\tFiction short film WAITING.\\nThrough the project in our slate, we expect several professionals to be benefited: \\n●\\tThe writers, directors and creators of the projects (2 male and 3 female).\\n●\\tOur all-female company team, which consists currently of 3 members, with the ambition to grow with the addition of one more producer. \\n●\\tA great number of production personnel and creatives, including script advisors, location managers, casting directors, cinematographers, art directors and marketing consultants, who will be engaged throughout the development process. \\nThe expected result is the successful development of above-mentioned projects up to the stage of production, delivery and distribution in collaboration with our international partners. \\n\\nAs we proceed with the development of the slate, we expect several outputs, which will include final scripts, final budgets and production schedules, updated creative team, updated financing plans and the confirmation of national, international and supranational funds and financiers.

I will also quantify the impact of theses processes on the climate and on the potential for prebiotic chemistry on these planets. I propose to consider the role of organic aerosols as prebio-signature: those are nanoparticles chemically produced in the atmosphere. I will address the capacity of exo-Earths atmospheres to produce organic aerosols in various oxidative conditions, and their further physical and chemical interactions with atmospheric water. \\n\\nTo tackle these questions, I will combine experiments and models to discover the reactivity that occurs in atmospheres within an extensive range of oxidation conditions. I will experimentally determine the physical properties of the aerosols, and then model their radiative impact and their propensity to generate clouds in the atmosphere. \\nI will also experimentally identify the prebiotic molecules composing the aerosols that dissolve into clouds. This transfer from the dry organic reservoir towards liquid water is indeed critical for the emergence of life.\\n\\nThe ERC-AdG Oxyplanets project will contribute to interpret and suggest observations for the future NASA-JWST and ESA-ARIEL space missions.

The festival has been held in largest Lithuanian cities (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai) and expanded to two more cities (Alytus and Panevezys) in 2022. Both years the festival took place synchronically in all of the cities, allowing to ensure the festival guests had the opportunity to visit and meet the audiences not only in the capital;\\\\n2. The scope of the festival programme has returned to the pre-pandemic levels, screening 80 feature films and 42 shorts in 2021 and 92 feature films and 26 shorts in 2022;\\\\n3. Both years significant efforts have been dedicated to bringing the audiences back to film theatres. In 2021 to ensure that the event has been held in a hybrid format, offering a part of the presented titles, online after the main physical even has finished. In 2022 the festival has taken place in a physical-only format with a strong focus on unique live screenings (e.g. a cine-concert of a Lithuanian feature film Burial by Emilija Skarnulyte with live music by Finnish composer Timo Kaukolampi in a unique cultural space “gallery 1986”), QnA with directors and other events;\\\\n4. The physical-only approach has proven to be the most effective in terms of post-pandemic audience growth. If in 2021 the overall admissions of the festival were 17300, in 2022 the audience grew by more than 20% and reached 21300. Though still not back to pre-pandemic numbers, this indicated a healthy enough rise.\\\\n5. Schoolchildren, students and seniors could attend designated screenings at a discount rate;\\\\n6. The number of applications for the international short film competition New Baltic Cinema doubled in 2021, presenting favourable conditions for the extension of the geography of the competition to whole Europe in 2022, while still maintaining a healthy growth in applications. The updated competition with a new name Glimpses of Europe took place at the anniversary edition of the festival in 2022.\\\\n7. In addition to the growth of the short film competition, in 2022 the festival launched the feature film competition, dedicated to films by European filmmakers with a unique aesthetic and style, and is aimed at discovering bold and original works and introducing them to new audiences. The goals of the competition correspond to those pursued by the festival as a part of the European film festivals network MIOB, these goals are:\\\\nto contribute to the distribution of original non-commercial European cinema;\\\\nto promote networking between European filmmakers;\\\\nto promote the spread of European values.\\\\n8. In 2021 / 2022 the festival stayed true to its mission of presenting national works in the context of European cinema and hosted a total number of 9 premieres of Lithuanian feature films;\\\\n9. A total of 20 masterclasses and discussions have been held as a part of annual industry events „SCA Directions“ (workshops for actors and scriptwriters, in-depth presentations of films, discussions on gendered violence, etc);\\\\n10. As part of yearly initiatives not limited to the main event in 2021 / 2022 the organisers of EFF Scanorama have conducted two satellite initiatives: the early film festival Pirmoji Banga, presenting pre-WWII cinema to general audiences and Scanorama Summer, bringing quality European cinema to remote parts of Lithuania. In addition, organisers have purchased and released a total of 17 high-profile European films in Lithuanian theatres, TV and VOD platforms, making a part of them available for various film literacy programmes;\\\\n11. As part of the activities of the MIOB network, the Green Charter for Film Festivals, an environmental initiative, was launched at the Cannes Film Festival. The network invites all film festivals to sign the charter and start implementing environmentally friendly practices. The draft charter was also presented to Lithuanian film festivals during the 2022 series of industry events, after which the representatives of local festivals have proceeded to sign the Charter.\",\"finalResults\":\"The results and achievements of 2021-2022 have contributed to:\\\\n1.

In the last century, the optimization of FET technology led to the discovery of a new state of matter, in which quantum mechanics fully confines any electron motion to parallel to the interfaces, i.e.  the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\\nMagnons, the elementary excitations of the ground state magnetic order (either ferro, ferri, or antiferromagnetic) also carry spin. In high-quality magnetic materials magnons enable long-distance electronic spin information transfer. Magnonics has been studied extensively in magnetic bulk materials, or in thin films where still several sub-bands are thermally populated. The challenging major next step is to realize and study magnon and electronic spin transport in the ultimate 2D magnetic regime.\\nThe aim of this ERC Advanced project is to combine and study strictly 2 dimensional spin transport in two types of vdW magnets: in a 2D magnon gas (2DMG) in electrically insulating Van der Waals ferro and antiferromagnets and in a 2D spin gas (2DSG) in proximity-induced magnetic graphene.\\nTo achieve this aim, I will (i) fabricate high quality 2D vdW materials, heterostructures and devices; (ii) realize and study spin transport in a two-dimensional magnon gas (2DMG); (iii) realize and study a two-dimensional spin gas (2DSG) in magnetic graphene; and (vi) develop new spintronics functionalities in hybrid 2DMG and 2DSG heterostructures.\\nThis project will open a regime that has not been explored before. Magnon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon (electronic) spin interactions in 2D will lead to phenomena that are either difficult to realize in 3D, such as hydrodynamic spin current flow and self-oscillations, or have not yet been anticipated at all. 2DMG and 2DSG controlled by gates and, possibly, operating at room temperature will enrich the vdW spintronics and provide new strategies for information technology including heat management. \\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Van der Waals materials', ' magnons'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053054'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2495000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999989782,\"legalName\":\"RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"9712CP\",\"street\":\"Broerstraat  5\",\"city\":\"Groningen\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"53.2193613\",\"longitude\":\"6.5621466\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2495000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['2DMAGSPIN'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

AGORA’s industry activities for development, co-production and promotion are focusing primarily on the following countries: Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Bosnia \\\\u0026 Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Egypt, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kosovo*, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, N. Macedonia, Palestine, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine, the majority of which are A/V LCC. Countries not on this list are still welcome to apply if they value Agora as a good springboard for their project. All projects are evaluated. \\\\n\\\\nDuring the years, AGORA evolved according to the industry’s needs: \\\\n \\\\n• Agora Talks presenting new trends and practical information from Europe’s leading experts, \\\\n• Thessaloniki Locarno Industry Academy for junior professionals in the diffusion sector, \\\\n• Meet the Future presenting local film professionals to the European and international film industry, \\\\n• Agora Short Film Lab in collaboration with the international short film festivals Drama ISFF and Clermont-Ferrand ISFF. \\\\n• Agora collaborates and hosts the EWA Mentoring Program bringing to Thessaloniki emerging female producers and their mentors. \\\\n• Agora TV Series will be inaugurated slowly but surely from the next edition with panels, open discussions, masterclasses, showcases, etc.\\\\n\\\\nAGORA SUMMARY:\\\\n•\\\\tAgora guests: 429 from 43 countries\\\\n•\\\\tFilm Market: 153 films from 51 countries, 2142 viewings \\\\n•\\\\tCrossroads Co-production Forum: 14 projects from 15 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tDot.on.the.map: 2 projects from 3 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tCineuropa Mini Co-production Market: 2 Italian projects from 4 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Works in Progress: 8 films from 10 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tThessaloniki Locarno Industry Academy: 8 participants from 5 different countries\\\\n•\\\\tEWA Mentoring Program: 8 mentors \\\\u0026 8 participants from 13 different countries\\\\n•\\\\tMeet the Future: 7 Greek Film Editors\\\\n•\\\\tAgora films in the Official Program: 9\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Awards: 12\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Talks: 8\",\"finalResults\":\"Impact and results of the 2021 Thessaloniki IFF AGORA:\\\\n\\\\nThe AGORA of the 62nd Thessaloniki IFF took place November 5-14 2021 in Thessaloniki \\\\u0026 Online. Due to the ongoing COVID – 19 pandemic the industry section was organized in a hybrid format. The total number of Agora Accredited guests was 429 from 43 different countries. The total number of PHYSICAL accredited guests was 259 -of which 136 international guests- and 83 online of which 70 internationals. In the online 2020 edition we had overall 414 online guests from 45 different countries.\\\\n\\\\nAGORA’s structuring approach from development to completed films and its impact on the region’s film industry is more and more visible as the projects we select and support circulate in the European film markets in their various stages of production and when complete they are selected in Festivals and distributed worldwide. Agora has been steadily turning Thessaloniki into the Fall’s Meeting Point for European films with a specific focus on Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, for all the right reasons.\\\\n\\\\nWe support the projects we have selected in development with advice and follow ups. We check when they are in post-production to see if they can be part of the Agora Works in Progress. If the timeline does not allow this, we offer advice on other suitable markets. \\\\n\\\\nChanges in our impact analysis would be to find advisors in the focus countries to suggest new projects from talented directors and their new projects. To network with the directors who have been selected to the Meet the Neighbors Competition of the Thessaloniki IFF and follow up on their new projects. To be more active on scouting new projects from awarded directors from our region. To focus more on genre films.\\\\n\\\\nIn the hybrid edition of the 62nd TIFF we presented nine films in the program that were part of the various AGORA activities, six of them were in the competition sections. \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, 5 out of the 8 selected films for the Agora Works in Progress 2022 previously participated at Crossroads Co-production Forum. \\\\n\\\\nCrossroads Co-production Forum counts 124 completed films since 2005 and Agora Works in Progress 118 since 2010.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-08-24\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-08-23\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053080', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053080/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': \"Filem'On -

The Summit Group of top industry professionals as well as the newly installed board keep its finger on the pulse of the rapidly evolving market.\\\\n\\\\nSERIAL EYES’ full-time, intensive programme equips young screenwriters to make the most of growing opportunities in this field through targeted teaching with hands-on assignments to teach dramaturgical and narrative strategies used in successful fiction series. \\\\n\\\\nParticipants’ collaborative work is central; the Writers’ Room workshop run by Frank Spotnitz (The X-Files) offers experience of working as a team and assuming the head writer role. Participants conceive and develop an individual, original series concept as well as a TV pilot and group projects in conjunction with industry partners. US and European showrunners, head writers, producers and commissioning editors share their experience (through mentoring/lectures/practical writing and pitching exercises). Workshops (UK/ Sweden) introduce participants to 2 major European markets with well-functioning, mature TV systems. A study trip to Séries Mania boosts networking with industry e.g. individual meetings with producers/commissioning editors. The SE Final Pitch at the end of each year’s programme in May offers an excellent platform for SE participants to pitch their work to broadcasters and network with industry professionals from many European countries. \\\\n\\\\nThe main postgraduate programme is complemented by a 10-week online Short Form Series screenwriting workshop in diverse storytelling to help emerging talents from less traditional screenwriting backgrounds and LGBTQ+ communities hone their skills.\\\\n\\\\nWebsite Serial Eyes: www.serial-eyes.com\\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SerialEyes/\\\\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/serial-eyes\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The Serial Eyes programme of studies is structured to intermesh theory and practice, as well as incorporating insights from industry professionals in masterclasses/workshops (in 2022 this included masterclases with showrunners like Susannah Grant “Unbelievable”, Jörg Winger “Deutschland 89” or Jantje Friese “Dark” ).

We are confident that this will also be the case for the alumni who have just completed this year’s programme in June.\\\\n\\\\nThis year participants worked on gripping individual projects; this entailed project development, as well as presentation to industry partners in the Midterm Pitch and responding to their feedback. These projects and contacts stand them in good stead as they continue to build their careers after the programme. Work on the group project also fosters teamwork skills with specific reference to the challenging process of devising and interweaving powerful narrative strands within a Writers‘ Room context. Extensive industry input and networking contacts ensures the programme reflects real-world concerns and issues.

According to the 2019 census, the population of the municipality is 5.892. \\\\nThe area of the Municipality of Puconci is where the sub-regions Ravensko and Goričko meet. The northern part of the municipality is much more hilly than the southern part, which stretches from the Lendava terrace to the flatlands. The hilly area of the municipality – covering 67% or 7.202 hectares of land – is part of the Goričko Nature Park, for it is a significant cultural landscape, which falls under protected natural and cultural areas by international standards. On 9 October 2003 the nature park became a protected area of national significance and in 2004 it was included into the Natura 2000 – the European ecological network of protected areas. The shape of the municipality resembles a rhombus, the northern part of which tilts towards the southeast.

The activities were mainly dedicated to culture and cultural dialogue in connection with traditional couisine. Our partner cities also have a similar cultural heritage, thus contributing to a dynamic European identity. The cuisine also shows the culture, especially our traditional, local dishes, so we decided to cook together our typical dish, dödole and the traditional dishes from our partner cities. In the evening we organised in the memorial house a round table on the theme of cultural differences and similarities of both nations. Present were speakers from Puconci, Zabok and Prelog from the cultural field of working. We compared our elements of cultural heritage and discussed on possible future common projects and events to promote the Slovene and Croatian culture to the wider European surrounding.\\\\nThe next day, the 28.8.2022 we organised a culture event with folk dancers from both partner cities. We presented to the wider audience traditional dances from Slovenia and Croatia.\\\\n\\\\nOn the 24.9.2022 we organised a round table about Europe and current events. The debate covered topics such as the current situation in the EU and how satisfied we are, what kind of Europe we want, how to promote intercultural dialogue and tolerance, and respect common values and history. Students prepared a program with workshops and an exhibition on the theme of the Day for Connection and Solidarity. In this way children and young people were encouraged to tolerance, friendship, coexistence and respectful relationships. \\\\n\\\\nOn the 25.9.2022 was a lecture with a student from Macedonia who is attending Puconci Primary School. He presented his thoughts about both countries. According to the present fear of war elementary school students participated in an evacuation exercise at a sign of danger. After that the event was followed by socializing over dinner and music, including musical inserts and presentations from partner countries.\\\\n\\\\nThe current situation in Europe is not easy. Not far from us, there is a war going on in Ukraine, where innocent people are suffering because of politics. People are fleeing in all directions, so we feel the invasion of refugees from Ukraine on our soil as well. The municipality of Puconci also donated food products and technical equipment to the city of Polyana from Ukraine.\\\\nEven our sister cities are feeling the war in Ukraine and are joining the actions of helping Ukraine.\\\\n\\\\nOn the 15.10.2022 we organised a professional lecture on how to deal with Covid-19 and how to help curb the pandemic although Covid-19 is not as present as one year ago. We organized a cultural event in which partner cities actively participated and told how they lived in these corona times. The next day, on the 16.10.2022 we organised a hike around the villages of the Municipality Puconci to promote a healthy life style.\\\\n\\\\nThrough the events, we achieved that the culture was mixed between different nationalities. Friendly ties were strengthened and new ties between different nations were established. New skills were acquired, as the way of singing, dancing and, last but not least, cuisine is different from country to country. In this way, experiences and opinions were also exchanged.

Every October we organise Cinekid Festival, a multidisciplinary event containing Film, Series, and New Media sections and media industry event Cinekid for Professionals. \\nCinekid Film Festival offers a wide diverse programme, emphasizing productions from European countries, which have a strong children’s film tradition. Films are not just screened but presented in a media-literacy framework. In-dept masterclasses and workshops are organized in connection to the films and together with Q&As they allow children to interact with the work and attending talent.  School screenings are hosted at the beginning of the festival, accompanied by custom-made educational material, introducing new audiences to our festival from an early age. \\nSimultaneously with the Amsterdam festival, Cinekid presents localized festivals with films, school screenings, and workshops at ca. 40 theatres all over the Netherlands. Throughout the year our online platform Cinekid Play, educational film catalogue, and interactive activities help us reach children across the country. On an international scale, Cinekid for Professionals promotes the circulation of European films.\\nFor our 35th and 36th editions, we will further develop our programme, while continuing to select with ambition, focusing on quality and geography diversity. MEDIA support is essential to reach these goals, as it allows us to strengthen our programme, increase visibility throughout the country and improve our impact year-round; maintaining our role as a guiding festival that gives new films, talent, and innovative initiatives a chance and enthuses the next generation for European film.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053110'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['82000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":946970164,\"legalName\":\"STICHTING CINEKID AMSTERDAM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"1018 JA\",\"street\":\"KATTENBURGERSTRAAT 5 GEBOUW 003-G\",\"city\":\"Amsterdam\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"52.36483835\",\"longitude\":\"4.914516336215238\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"82000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['CK2021-2022'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:08.769+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053110/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053110/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['82000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:08.692+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053110'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053110_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"The Cinekid Foundation believes that films are a valuable part of our shared culture that offers children and young people a window on the world around them. Films invites children to reflect on and discuss previously unknown topics and encourages children to develop their critical senses. It is therefore important to give children access to high quality productions from around Europe because these films broaden their view of the world, make them curious about other people\\\\u0027s stories and helps to appreciate all kinds of art in the future. As a long running children’s film festival, Cinekid Film Festival believes itself to be a quality label for children media productions in the Netherlands. Every October we feel a responsibility to present a wide-ranging and diverse film programme. We want to engage children with a film festival that contains a wide variety of high-quality audio-visual productions from as many different countries as possible. When selecting films, Cinekid Film Festival doesn’t want to only screen films that are easily available, instead we want to expand on the available children’s film in The Netherlands by presenting new high-quality titles from all over the world, including many that would not otherwise get presented in cinemas. We want to showcase productions from underrepresented regions, films with challenging topics, and forms of children’s cinema that are less commercially viable, such as youth documentaries and short films. Cinekid wants to reach all the children in the Netherlands. It’s therefore important to emphasize that Cinekid Film Festival takes place nationwide. Simultaneously Cinekid presents smaller Cinekid Festivals with current festival programming, accompanying school screenings and connected workshops at ca. 40 theatres all over the Netherlands. The Film Festival also doesn’t stop after October, but Cinekid has developed various educational initiatives and online platforms, such as Cinekid Play, intended to connect with children through the year.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"How fortunate that the Cinekid Festival could physically take place in October 2021, thanks to the newly introduced corona app and tests for access! It was great to let children enjoy the films, the MediaLab and all (partly) free indoor and outdoor meetings and activities together with their parents and carers without social distancing. The main location in Amsterdam Noord was a brand new place where we programmed together with Noorderlingen. Eventhough the location in Amsterdam-Noord was new, we managed to bring back our audience to the cinema in Amsterdam, and throughout the country! Many new schools have also discovered our festival, as evidenced by the record number of visitors to the school program in Amsterdam. The opening film Captain Nova by Michiel Trouwborst (De Rules van Floor) was received with great enthusiasm by the public and media and won the two jury prizes for Best Children\\\\u0027s Film. There were many (inter)national premieres: like the animated series Anansi de Spin. And not only in Amsterdam. Cinekid Festival took place throughout the country, with eight large and more than 26 small locations in the region. The festival could also be experienced from the living room. Via our digital platform Cinekid Play, our online visitors had access to a selection of the festival content for eight euros. And there was the Cinekid Festival Box, with which children started working from home to make their own thaumatrope and to do countless mini workshops together with friends and family. In addition to the festival, it was unfortunately very limited possible in 2021 to develop the year-round physical activities. This was partly due to the closing of the film theaters, our partners. The year-round activities therefore mainly took place in digital forms, together with Pathe.nl, Cinekid Play and our social media channels, among others. Our online school program was also used intensively.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 Cinekid Festival was back like before In Amsterdam North on the Buiksloterplein and across the country at 28 locations. It was the second year at the Buikslotermeerplein in North Amsterdam. With the relatively new team, a festival was set up with a beautiful visible campaign, where, in addition to the Dutch public, international professionals were also present at the Amsterdam main location. In addition to Amsterdam, the opening film Totem also drew full houses at the national locations and resulted in many great conversations after the school performances. The special program around Guest of the Year Burny Bos celebrated the timeless quality of his many youth productions and inspired many new audiences and, not unimportantly, many new makers to start making youth content as well.\",\"finalResults\":\"In 2021 it quickly became clear that the hope of recovery and the possibility of reconciliation after the first year of the pandemic remained very limited. After half a year of the closure of cinemas, film theatres, festivals and cultural activities, there was a brief revival in which visits, limited, became possible again. Unfortunately, this \\\\u0027summer of love\\\\u0027 was short-lived and the corona app and tests for access caused a lot of unrest. The Cinekid festival in October certainly experienced the necessary effects of this, as the introduction of the corona app for cinema visits was only introduced two weeks before the start of the festival. But it was great to receive our audience without 1.5 meters after entering. A huge happiness. After all, not long after that, the Netherlands was locked again and unfortunately no physical meeting was possible in the cultural sector.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 many of Cinekid Festival\\\\u0027s most prominent team members thought it was time for something new. Therefore the festival in 2022 was organized by many new team members. t was the second year at the Buikslotermeerplein in North Amsterdam. We grew our audience and the involvement of children in our festival was intensified, which reseulted in a beautiful visible campaign. We have chosen to focus on physical encounters during the festival. The period of recovery in the festival sector is still in full swing. Public behavior has changed and is still evolving. It was therefore exciting to see whether the audience was able to find their way back and whether the new path that Cinekid has taken; to be really accessible and to shape the festival together with our audience has paid off. The number of visits approached our record-breaking 2019, only 11% lower than in the pre-corona year.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nThroughout the year, Cinekid organized high impact programs at school and in collaboration with various partners. The growth in those activities is considerable, doubling in a year\\\\u0027s time. The digital activities developed by Cinekid were an extension of the festival\\\\u0027s activities last year. Digital platform Cinekid Play streamed a selection of short films throughout the year, as well as tips for games and apps to do at home. There was intensive collaboration with digital partners such as Scula and Lesson Up to bring Cinekid workshops to children\\\\u0027s homes and schools. And research was done in the field of innovation. The digital transition has been scrutinized again: how can Cinekid be relevant within its digital mission now that the urgency of lockdowns has disappeared? What will Cinekid develop itself? Where are the needs?\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053090', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053090/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '409FFC762BB3A55B8BDD15861EED75A6148705D349B7FADF3A61710ED83274DD', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.035+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-11-30T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053090_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Catalogue 2022\",\"description\":\"Print \\\\u0026 online.

Although often thought of as an invariant representation of active nociceptors, pain varies a lot under the influence of different affective states, sometimes with near complete analgesia. Such modulation of pain is thought to occur through a descending pathway originating in the brain and to be executed by Rostral Ventromedial Medulla (RVM) neurons that project to the spinal cord. Deciphering the complexity of the cell types involved and how they contribute to the descending control of pain has been challenging, but recent advances in single-cell omics, computational biology and advanced genetic technologies now open for unbiased system-wide insights.\\n\\nDescendPain will uncover the power of the brain to control pain. We will classify RVM neuron types by single-cell RNA-sequencing and use scRNAseq-based stimulus-to-cell-type mapping to identify neuronal ensembles conferring analgesia and hyperalgesia during morphine, naloxone, stress, sleep-deprivation and exercise. Using activity-based mouse genetics, we will reveal the full complexity of the combinations of neurons engaged and unravel their role in pain modulation, thus identifying for the first time the cellular basis for how affective states modulate pain. We will also use novel intersectional strategies for dual capturing of active neurons to determine how the descending RVM controls the transmission of pain in the ascending pathway of the spinal cord. Finally, we will identify the memory substrate underlying chronic pain, providing evidence for the existence of RVM neuron ensembles of chronic pain and revealing underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. \\n\\nThis project takes a new system-wide strategy in the pain field that should fundamentally change the view of pain, by providing a cellular basis for how it is continuously scaled by mental states and uncovering mechanisms of chronic pain, which may provide strategies for designing effective pain therapies.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['single cell RNA-sequencing', ' somatosensation', ' chronic pain'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053091'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2500000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999978530,\"legalName\":\"KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"17177\",\"street\":\"Nobels Vag 5\",\"city\":\"Stockholm\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Sweden\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"59.496510549999996\",\"longitude\":\"18.22277924122159\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2500000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['DescendPain'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.715+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053091/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053091/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2500000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-02T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.698+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101053091'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2023-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053102', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053102/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'FABIAN', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'FABIAN', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '9C7E6D9C20DE23999657CA854B93B16F349D85BD834B6D53A5AA2518EAF70720', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:07.654+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['FABIAN'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053102_3_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Marketing Material\",\"description\":\"Link to promotional material: \\\\n\\\\nPresskit (English), Poster (English), Trailer (English subs), Stills :\\\\n\\\\nhttps://filmsdulosange.com/en/film/fabian/\\\\nTeasers (English subs):\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/v/39KypeN3U/\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/v/5ANpTiC0M/\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/\\\\n\\\\nMarketing material adapted by Distributor\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project Coordination and Sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-06-16\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5fd2c0ee0/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['9C7E6D9C20DE23999657CA854B93B16F349D85BD834B6D53A5AA2518EAF70720'], 'objective': [\"Selected to the very prestigious Official Competition of the Berlinale 2021 (which had a special edition this year due to the pandemic and took place in two parts: first an online premiere in March 2021, followed by the first physical screening during Berlinale Summer Special in June 2021), Fabian by Dominik Graf has started a worldwide journey, within and beyond the European borders. As the first laudatory reviews launched the career of the film, many European distributors have noticed its potential. Both the strength of its mise en scene and the great performance of the actresses and actors performing in Fabian were greatly acclaimed by the international press. \\n“Berlin, 1931, Jakob Fabian works in the advertising department of a cigarette factory during the day and drifts through bars, brothels and artist studios with his wealthy friend Labude at night. When Fabian gets to know the self-confident Cornelia, he manages to shed his pessimistic attitude for a brief moment. He falls in love. But then he too falls victim to the great wave of layoffs, while Cornelia makes a career as an actress thanks to her boss and admirer. An arrangement that Fabian finds difficult to come to terms with. But it's not just his world that is falling apart...”\\nThis period drama describes a crucial time in Europe: the rise of Nazism during the interwar period, a European common past that Fabian’s producers, sales agent, and distributors all share. Lately, sanitary and socio-economic crisis tend to threat some of our European values. Eighteen distributors gathered to decide a pan-European strategy to present this acclaimed movie to the European audience.

CfP initially organised seminars, an international conference, co-production markets and network meetings. Later the ScreeningClub followed; a ‘video library’ with hundreds of titles that draws buyers and programmers from all over the world. Today CfP attracts more than 500 media professionals from 40 different countries and, aside from in-depth conferences and network opportunities, offers more than 350 screenings. The event is seen as the leading platform for the international youth media industry.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"After an online edition in 2020, we organized Cinekid for Professionals (CfP) 2021 in a hybrid form. Our guests were able to attend in Amsterdam, but also from home in our online environment. In total, CfP had 546 visitors, 149 attended online and 387 visitors came to Amsterdam to attend the program live. The program was rated with an average of 8 (on a scale of 10) by the guests (impact research was done by Cigarbox). An important and unique element of CfP is that it takes place simultaneously with the Cinekid Festival. This provides opportunities for participants and projects to make contact with the target group, for input on their projects in the development phase. Insight into the target group is very important to us, which is why we had a session in the Industry Forum (conference programme) with children, who told more about their experience and how they watch films and series. In 2021, Kids Kino Industry and CfP joined forces to launch Producers LINK, a newly established program for emerging children\\\\u0027s content producers to stimulate co-production between Eastern and Western Europe. CfP also remains the place where the industry can meet in an informal atmosphere. A place for exchange, inspiration, groundbreaking projects (both in form and in themes), where interdisciplinary is stimulated and a place where young talents and experienced makers are connected. Talent development is an important spearhead in this respect and our Script LAB (screenwriter program) and Directors LAB (director program) are growing every year. In 2021 we also collaborate with ROSE Stories Writersroom and FilmForward Vrijplaats (Young Perspectives), two talent initiative programmes who both focus mainly on autodidacts and people who aspire to create in media feel like their stories need to be told.\",\"finalResults\":\"Young audiences are the industry\\\\u0027s future audience. Working with the children and youth audience implies that the impact of present action is extremely far reaching and does not involve only current participants and projects but the entirety of the audiovisual industry in a very long term perspective.The Cinekid Foundation applies a holistic approach when it comes to serving the audiovisual industry and its young audience. Our contribution targets creation, production as well as promotion and our action has a structuring effect for the whole industry in the specific sub sector addressing children and youth. We start with creation through our pioneering training programmes:  the Cinekid Script LAB, an international workshop aimed at screenwriters; work towards the production in the Cinekid Directors LAB, an international workshop aimed at directors;  ZappDoc LAB (national documentary workshop for directors, supported by the Dutch broadcasting fund NPO-fonds and Dutch broadcaster NPO Zapp). We support production by facilitating projects to find new sources of financing in our efficient Junior Co- production Market (JCM), fostering new collaborations and co-creation in our newly shaped Producers LINK programme and boosting networking, news business developments and co-creation in our inspiring conference programme the Industry Forum. Finally,  our contribution to promotion and circulation is done through Cinekids very own efficient buyers and sellers platform, the ScreeningClub, and of course the Cinekid Festival (for which a complementary application has been granted in the Call European Festivals). We support projects in the entire chain of development. This holistic approach gives a production the right quality label, promotion and springboard to take off to other major festivals and to be acquired for international distribution.\\\\nSince the start of our Junior Co-production Market in 2004, Script LAB in 2014 and Directors LAB in 2021, over 45% of the projects that have been selected for these programmes have either premiered at major European film festivals, screened on global streaming platforms, broadcasted on television or are currently in (post-)production. \\\\nCinekid gives lots of importance to the collection and analysis of data. The long series of historical data  provides us with a deep insight of the industry evolution and new trends. In particular, we know about the success and market performance of our participants by closely keeping in touch with the children’s media industry, potential participants and most importantly former participants of our programmes. An additional way to measure the impact of our programmes is the rate of returning participants or production companies with their projects. \\\\nWe reach out to the audiovisual community that’s working with a children and youth’s audience, through our partners, ambassadors and our network. They are mainly European and support us in our action to strengthen the European children and youth’s media industry. They act as ambassadors and identify new and upcoming European professionals for us to invite and/or make them aware of our action. We also reach out to international institutes  who support producers to attend Cinekid and spread our calls for entries and accreditations.\\\\nCinekid has a solid structuring effect on the European audio-visual industry as a whole (children and youth subsector) mainly through the annual forum that brings together all the main European producers, financiers, buyers, sales agents, branding companies and others working in the children’s media industry for a focused meeting programme with various events. The event is not a coyuntural occasion but has continuity throughout the year by several means. Since the industry and the audience needs to develop so quickly we want to shift more from an annual momentum to events and more visibility throughout the year. We actively serve as matchmakers at different festivals and international markets, online and in person. We make sure to deliver industry information and insights via our platform. We make sure to link the right people to each other in order to set-up pan- European collaboration. We are a platform with a showcase function and in everything we do we want to stimulate the European/International Children’s Media Industry; by promoting films, stimulating co- productions, sharing knowledge and bringing professionals together.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-05-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-04-30\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053100', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053100/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '4189E343CFB482F971D2535178B7394FE571A72AE31D399D9B7FCECFE34F99CC', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:07.318+0200'], 'endDate': ['2024-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['4189E343CFB482F971D2535178B7394FE571A72AE31D399D9B7FCECFE34F99CC'], 'objective': ['\"Le catalogue de projet présenté par Xilam Animation est composé de 5 projets de série d\\'animation :\\n\\n- \"\"Toddl\\'Heroes\"\" : une série comique en 3D\\n- \"\"Potobot\"\" : une série qui vise à sensibiliser les enfants à la protection de l\\'environnement\\n- \"\"Retour à la Terre\"\" : une série adaptée de la BD éponyme \\n- \"\"Phil & Sophia\"\" : une série 100% éducative basée sur la philosophie\\n- \"\"Piggy Builders\"\" : une série préscolaire en 3D\\n\\n\"\"Phil & Sophia\"\" sera produite par Xilam Animation.

This represents a crucial & fantastic audience for both national and non-national European films throughout our continent. Even beyond, just considering how many libraries there are in the world. Still, one main issue remains: many of these European films are still only available for rent as one single DVD or Blu-ray per European library (!), if available at all - while European citizens - and further citizens - have been used for years now to get access to films using online digital platforms with flat offers – like from big American platforms to get access to few European films. We as filmfriend, an established European digital flat fee film solution for libraries, as well as company fond of European films, believe there still is a big online forgotten marketplace in the European Union, and that we, as Europeans, should be first to invest in: the European online film market for libraries. Investing in this market would mean supporting the European film industry on a further audience market, strengthening the online digital European film offer towards a real significant number of European users, as well as encouraging cultural exchange and the values of the European Union. In 2017, we launched filmfriend in Germany with only 1 library. Just a few years later, we count almost 400 European libraries participating, not only in Germany but also in Austria & Switzerland, making filmfriend already available for 3,000,000 users in Europe! Thanks to the Creative Europe programme, we already started to work last year on further expansion on the EU territory, adding French and Dutch-speaking territories (BE, Lux, FR, NL) to our “targets” as well as English-speaking ones like UK and Ireland.

These include supporting emerging European talents, increasing the quality of feature films and drama series production, and providing training on skills critical for adaptation in a rapidly changing environment.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, MIDPOINT Institute\\\\u0027s proposed activities aimed at providing comprehensive training and support to talents in the Region were successful. Over 110 talented individuals received complex training designed to enhance their skills and capabilities in their respective fields. The outreach events organized as part of the initiative were also highly effective, with over 100 talents trained through vocational consultations and workshops in conjunction with various festivals and markets or independently.\\\\n\\\\nWhat sets MIDPOINT Institute apart is the complexity of the training offered, combined with access to market opportunities. Its Feature Launch and Series Launch programs hold a unique position in the market as the only European training programs providing comprehensive project and skills development training focused on an early stage of development.

In addition, the organization also conducted its follow-up modules, including Company Time, Editing Room, and Next Season.\\\\nThe Feature Launch program was designed to provide in-depth training to writers, producers, and directors working on their first or second feature films. The program consisted of two residential workshops, in Prague and Karlovy Vary, with the final presentation of projects and an award of 10 000 EUR for the best project in development. The program also included two online workshops to provide comprehensive project development support for the participants.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, the Series Launch program was designed to support writers, producers, and directors emerging from film to series production. The program consisted of three residential workshops: in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with the final workshop and presentation of projects within the Industry@Tallinn and Baltic Event. Additional online support during the workshop was provided to the participants who received comprehensive training from industry experts.\\\\n\\\\nEach program was opened to 9 teams of writers, producers, and directors with feature films or long-form series projects in development. Also, three script consultant trainees (Feature Launch) and development executive participants (Series Launch) followed the whole development training for each program. They were trained for their future careers as script consultants or commissioning editors.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the follow-up modules, including Company Time, Editing Room, and Next Season, were designed to provide additional support to the Feature Launch and Series Launch program participants. Company Time allowed participants to focus on their companies with the support of experienced mentors. In contrast, the Editing Room gave them dramaturgical feedback on their rough cuts. Lastly, the online module Next Season was designed to help participants refine the development and production strategies of sustainable film and series production.\",\"finalResults\":\"MIDPOINT Institute\\\\u0027s Feature Launch and Series Launch programs and follow-up modules Company Time, Next Season, and Editing Room have significantly impacted the participants, their projects, the companies involved, and the European audiovisual sector a whole.\\\\n\\\\nPrograms have enabled participants to acquire new skills and expertise and develop a compelling, competitive development portfolio for feature films or scripted fiction series. The programs have also provided them with deep insights into the professional development process and tools to efficiently find a place for themselves in the competitive workforce. Participants have better understood good practices, allowing them to compete and access better in their respective Regional and European markets, which has helped expand their professional network and build important relationships.\\\\n\\\\nIhe main objective of MIDPOINT Institute in terms of content is to support the creation of high-quality writing and explore strong local stories that can be universally understood while still respecting the author\\\\u0027s intention. The programs encourage the development of \\\\\"glocal\\\\\" projects, which have a better chance of becoming international co-productions and finding new creative options for their financing models. International program set-ups also lead to greater possibilities when considering distribution territories. Participants were encouraged to consider new distribution channels, including European or VOD platforms or other business and financing partners.\\\\n\\\\nCompanies participating in the programs learned how to position themselves within the local and transnational industry and access a wider network via their tutors, experts, and attending professionals during and beyond the programs. They acquired financing models, an understanding of context, and the position of the European audiovisual industry enables them to deliver the content of greater value and interest to the international industry. Participants also gained skills in company development, thus gaining the know-how to lead a sustainable business. Companies that work within the film and television industry benefited from the participants having a healthier and more realistic idea of the current state of affairs.\\\\n\\\\nMIDPOINT Feature Launch and Series Launch programs and their follow-up modules have become assets for the Regional and European audiovisual sector, offering a portfolio of trained emerging professionals thoroughly developed projects with international potential from the Region.

Experience with process-simulation based scale-up shows that these uncertainties will likely result in large additional costs and delays.\\nTo improve the description of properties of hydrogen and to enable the application of advanced lique-faction concepts, fundamental breakthroughs are required with regard to the metrology of fluids at cryogenic temperatures and with regard to accurate modelling of these complex systems – ThermoPro-pHy addresses this pioneering scientific work. Experimental equipment will be developed that allows for highly accurate measurements of density and speed of sound at temperatures down to the triple point of hydrogen (14 K), far below current temperature limits. Property models will be developed that yield a highly accurate and consistent description of arbitrary mixtures of ortho- and parahydrogen for the first time, including the effects of the temperature dependent ortho/para-equilibrium. Solid phases of impurities affecting large-scale liquefaction processes will be described by models that are con-sistent to accurate fluid-phase models. Measurements and modelling of mixtures of helium, neon, and argon will establish an accurate basis for the application of mixed fluid cascade (MFC) processes for hydrogen liquefaction.\\nThermoPropHy will result not only in scientific breakthroughs with regard to the metrology of fluids and to accurate modelling of thermodynamic properties, but also in increased accuracy and credibility of process simulations for hydrogen technologies.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['hydrogen', ' hydrogen transport', ' hydrogen storage', ' hydrogen processing', ' thermodynamic properties', ' cryogenic mixtures'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053133'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2457146'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999988812,\"legalName\":\"RUHR-UNIVERSITAET BOCHUM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"44801\",\"street\":\"UNIVERSITAETSSTRASSE 150\",\"city\":\"Bochum\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.4456125\",\"longitude\":\"7.2610298\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2457146\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['ThermoPropHy'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:13.848+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053133/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053133/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2457146'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-17T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:13.830+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101053133'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2022-10-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053135', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053135/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '5CDAA4D52694E934E76C32A76D67844754008823FA421EBC60CD8B7AFF051391', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:14.034+0200'], 'endDate': ['2024-08-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['5CDAA4D52694E934E76C32A76D67844754008823FA421EBC60CD8B7AFF051391'], 'objective': [\"The slate consists of five fictional film projects with very different genres, formats and target groups.

In breast cancer, aggressiveness correlates with fibrotic stiffening of the tumour. There is an urgent need to understand how the fibrotic microenvironment evolves, to design better targeted cancer therapies. Fibrotic stiffening is caused by fibroblasts secretion of a matrix with mechanical properties that stabilise the tumour vascular network. However, the hierarchy and stability of the tumour vascular network are not reproducible in vitro. To advance the field, I will develop a revolutionary platform able to recapitulate tumour fibrosis by exploiting the vascularisation of a living organism.\\nTo achieve my goal, I will use human breast cancer cells adhering to 3D polymeric micro scaffolds to create arrays of tumour micro environments. I will implant the arrays in vivo in the chorioallantoic membrane of an embryonated avian egg, to elicit a foreign-body fibrotic reaction. I will vary the micro scaffolds geometry to condition tumour infiltration by the host’s vessels and cells. I will exploit fluorescent spatial beacons incorporated in the micro scaffolds for multiphoton image correlation, to derive morphological and functional information of the regenerated fibrous matrix and vessels.

GFF presented its 45th edition on Jan 28 - Feb 6, 2022, and its 46th edition on Jan 27 - Feb 5, 2023, the first two editions of the festival that offered cinematic experiences to the audience both in cinemas and at home.\\\\n\\\\nThe 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival presented a diverse and high-quality program of about 200 relevant films annually. The festival continued to promote its competition programmes and to put the spotlight on talents, debutants as well as masters, and drew among others attention to internationally acclaimed artistry by handing out three honorary awards during the period, to the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson and the Swedish director Jan Troell.\\\\n\\\\nAn important aim was to be a vibrant arena for meetings and discussions and GFF did therefore invite directors, producers, and actors to come and meet the audience. In 2022, GFF was forced to limit the number of invitations, due to the pandemic, but did still welcome over one hundred talents. In 2023, GFF could once again welcome talents from all over world.\\\\n\\\\nThe 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival hosted the annual film market, Nordic Film Market, which today is the most important meeting place for an international film industry with an interest in films from the five Nordic countries. Nordic Film Market is a launch pad for Nordic films to reach out to international film festivals and international TV and cinema distribution. Nordic Film Market was accessible both on-site in Göteborg and from all over the world on the festival’s own digital platform. GFF also continued to arrange its one-year networking forum, Nordic Film Lab, open to producers, directors and screenwriters from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the main festival, GFF continued to arrange its satellite events: Göteborg Film Festival Prisma (Children\\\\u0027s film festival in October) and Göteborg Film Festival Open Air, as well as continued with its all-year activities with regional and avant-premiere screenings together with an extensive workshop program for children and schools in the region of Västra Götaland.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The main achievement of the 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival was to successfully implement hybrid editions of the festival. GFF constantly strives to disseminate its program to attract new audiences, and to make the festival more accessible. Through the digital program GFF becomes relevant for audiences in Sweden regardless of where they reside. At the same time, GFF wants to continue to value the collective experience of watching films together in cinemas. A combination of the two objectives were manifested at the inauguration of both GFF 2022 and 2023, where the opening night film celebrated its world premiere simultaneously on the festival’s digital platform as well as in more than 70 cinemas located all around Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nGFF 2022 displayed a program of 202 films (152 features and 50 shorts), presented in 15 sections. The films originated from 74 different countries, of which 31 were European MEDIA countries. Out of 157 European films, 105 were of non-national origin. GFF 2023 displayed a program of 225 films (176 features and 49 shorts), presented in 14 sections. The films originated from 73 different countries, of which 34 were European MEDIA countries. Out of 188 European films, 120 were of non-national origin. Five sections presented the competition line-up (42 films in 2022 and 49 films in 2023), and annually, one section introduced the thematic focus of the year. In 2022, 46% of the films screened had a female director and in 2023, 48% of the films had a female director.\\\\n\\\\nGFF offered its audience about 550 screenings in 16 cinemas in 2022 and 700 screenings in 18 cinemas in 2023. The digital program presented about 50 films annually to audiences all over Sweden. Thanks to the digital program, GFF could maintain its large audience despite the Omicron-outbreak that reached its peak in Sweden during the festival week in 2022. Every online screening was introduced by a festival host together with a greeting from the filmmakers.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with the screenings, every edition of GFF presented a large number of moderated talks and Q\\\\u0026A’s. A few guests, like the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, Austrian director Marie Kreutzer, French director Lucile Hadzihalilovic and Romanian director Radu Jude also held public master classes. Some of the master classes were recorded and published on the festival’s social platforms. For the recipient of the honorary awards GFF also arranged retrospective screenings to celebrate their artistry. Beyond the talks in cinemas, GFF broadcasted a live talk show, Studio Draken, and a podcast every day.\",\"finalResults\":\"At times when the size of the audience at cinemas has decreased due to the pandemic, GFF, thanks to the online program, has managed to increase its audience in total. The great interest for the festival’s digital program clearly shows that the festival is on the right path strategically. The festival’s investments in enhancing the streaming experience, the tableau format that points out every single film premiere, the introductions by the filmmakers, and the extensive material with interviews through the festival’s podcast and Studio Draken, reaches out to extensive audiences all over Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nGöteborg Film Festival has continued working on finding films from as many European countries as possible. The main reason is that GFF firmly believes in diversity as an aspect of quality. GFF is carefully monitoring the European festivals and markets (both the major and smaller ones) that are important launch pads for new projects. GFF programmers are attending as many European festivals and markets as possible, cover others digitally, and then get in touch directly with the filmmakers or representatives.\\\\n\\\\nGöteborg Film Festival is an important launch pad for films from the five Nordic countries, why these always have a prominent place in the festival. About 2000 professionals visited the festival in 2023. The festival’s annual market, Nordic Film Market, arranged market screenings of completed Nordic films, work in progress presentations of Nordic films in post-production and presentations of Nordic projects in development. To help the circulation of European works after the festival, partnership with digital distributors is essential. Göteborg Film Festival’s streaming platform, Draken Film, obtain most of its films from the festival program. In 2022, Draken Film also started distributing European films for cinema and VOD-release in Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nSustainability work\\\\nIn 2022 and 2023, GFF continued to adapt its activities and events to meet sustainability requirements and minimize negative environmental impact. GFF urged all invited Scandinavian guests to travel by train or bus to Göteborg. Food and refreshments provided by the festival was ecological and mainly vegetarian, no meat was served.

EDT is the continuation of the eponym project, supported by Creative Europe in 2020-21.\\nCoordinated by VOD aggregator Under the Milky Way International (UMWI), EDT is the result of our 11 years of experience in digital distribution; working with 600 rights holders and a library of 6,000 films. Over the years, we witnessed the emergence of increasingly creative films, financed outside of traditional schemes, primarily intended for digital distribution. At the same time, we are experiencing radical changes in consumer habits; notably from audiences shying away from tv and theaters to digital platforms. Plus, these platforms are predominantly US; thus, shifting the control of exhibition in Europe away from EU-controlled interests, both public and private.\\nWe believe that the EU Film industry must live up to this challenge by offering an adapted answer both in terms of film creation and distribution. Its future competitivity and relevance depends on its capacity to harness emerging creative forces before they are reaped by the GAFAN. As a result, EDT relies on UMW’s capacity to identify “digital-native” talents whose films are produced outside of traditional circuits. UMW then ensures that these films reach the most prominent platforms in the world, supported by adapted marketing campaigns to effectively address audiences. In short, EDT will over the next 3 years: 1/ build an offer of 20 digital-native EU films, 2/ create and implement adapted marketing strategies, and 3/ coordinate direct-to-digital distribution around the world.\\nThe European dimension of EDT is both operational and political as it aims at renewing and promoting EU creativity and talents in Europe and beyond by relying on the long run on a new business model 100% digital and fully integrated in terms of production and distribution.\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Digital Talents', ' Digital Distribution', ' VOD platforms'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053124'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-INNOVBUSMOD'], 'overallBudget': ['1095248.79'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":939071551,\"legalName\":\"UNDER THE MILKY WAY INTERNATIONAL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75002\",\"street\":\"4 RUE DU CAIRE\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8672053\",\"longitude\":\"2.3524531\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"657149\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":true}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['EDT Rise and Shine'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:12.904+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['60'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053124/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053124/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['657149'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-22T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:12.811+0200'], 'topicId': ['44017955'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053124'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2022-03-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053124_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"Under The Milky Way’s (UMW) specific and unique positioning in the film industry is at the origin of Europe Digital Talents (EDT). Indeed, as a film aggregator, UMW acts as an intermediary between rights-holders (producers, distributors, and sales agents) on both global and local VoD platforms around the world. \\\\nSuch a unique positioning allows UMW to reinforce its analysis of the industry’s ongoing digital mutations, and to witness the emergence of a new generation of \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" talents and consumers increasingly deserting traditional distribution networks,\\\\nIn terms of creation, that generation masters the digital technologies, which democratizes the access to production tools, and lowers the barriers of producing films. We are starting to see films in the US that are produced by digital-native talents directly for digital distribution, however that model has yet to emerge in an organized way in Europe. \\\\nAs an audience, the inherent web-culture of younger, digital-savvy audiences, consumes content, including films, online in a different way than older generations. Younger audiences are completely familiar with the different VOD models and are even willing to pay for films released on VOD and theaters at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nAs of today, UMW covers more than 120 territories, works with more than 600 rights holders and has more than 6,000 films under mandate that are currently distributed on more than 50 platforms. \\\\nOver the years, we noticed an increasing number of \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" films that chose UMW’s distribution services to reach their audience. These films, produced in a non-traditional way (i.e. outside of the main traditional funding mechanisms in Europe), are mostly intended for an audience that is also \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" (16 to 37 years old - aka Millennials / Generation Z). \\\\nMotivated by a strong conviction that this creativity is intended to be shared as widely as possible, UMW hopes that its intervention will contribute to the emergence of new European talents committed to a digital future. \\\\nIn 2019, UMW launched Originals x UMW. As of today, UMW released 26 films under this “digital-native” label directly to multiple VoD platforms. Some of these films are included in the EDT program and can thus benefit from the support of Creative Europe. Launched in 2020, this sub-label included 6 films to be released in 2021. EDT Rise and Shine is the follow up of this action and aims at widening its scope both in terms of content and distribution footprint, and to allow for an industrialized and virtuous model to emerge.\\\\n\\\\nObjectives\\\\n-\\\\tRenewing European talents at global level based on digital distribution networks and their audiences.\\\\nEDT’s approach is to identify such talent and provide them with an initial steppingstone for their projects. The sourcing and management of these digital-native talents coupled with UMW’s global distribution network is an unprecedented and concrete offer to the needs of the industry on the creators’ side.\\\\n-\\\\tStrategically positioning a European company to prevent the GAFANs from pre-empting of new sources of creativity directly, and, as such, providing them with a credible and organized partner. EDT’s unique positioning on smaller budget films allows for the development of a production model that can be, on the hand, economically viable and independent of platform pre-financing, on the other. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tTargeting and addressing an emerging global digital audience. \\\\nThere is an increasingly large audience accessing film content online. This used to be primarily limited to younger digital-savvy audiences, but recent events also changed habits of mature audiences as evidenced by the increasing consumption of films online. EDT addresses this market full of potential and aims at providing platforms with content to help in their diversification. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tOffering the tools, organization and expertise necessary to roll out a new distribution and promotion model in Europe. \\\\nUMW’s expertise as a first mover in the fields of global aggregation allows it to maximize the value of the films and catalogs under management.With its extensive global coverage, and access to all global platforms and of the main local platforms across all VoD business models (TVOD, AVOD, SVOD), as well as through the collection and analysis of sales and revenue data, UMW offers a real “Library Intelligence Solution”, for rights holders. In addition, UMW’s experience through several years of investments in digital marketing provides a concrete benchmark and expertise to ensure efficient digital promotion efforts. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tProposing to talents and their producers, a clear and transparent scheme for the exploitation of their films : EDT aims to develop an economic model that is both direct and flexible and ensures total transparency allowing in the medium-long term to function without pre-financing models as royalties flow back in a regular and efficient way.

At the general project level: A regularly updated website that serves as a showcase for the project. In addition, a communication campaign was set up in Cannes to publicize the project and recruit films.\\\\n. At the level of each film release: tailor-made marketing strategies are created with the strong involvement of the film teams.\\\\n\\\\n1.3 Coordination of direct-to-digital VOD distribution around the world : In terms of distribution, our positioning as an aggregator has enabled us to target a very large number of platforms and to optimize the operating model (from TVOD to AVOD via the T-SVOD offered by Amazon) in order to to guarantee the greatest possible coverage for films in terms of operating platform\",\"finalResults\":\"•\\\\tImpact in terms of availability and geographical coverage: It is still too early to analyze the results of the first films, insofar as there are only a few months of exploitation.

It is the aim to have the films circulate in countries outside of Europe.\\\\n\\\\nFSS enables companies to create additional promotional tools, to improve new digital approaches and experiment with innovative ideas. It is paramount for films at international film festivals and markets to receive a prominent promotion so that they may stand out amongst the vast number of available films to be sold to as many international countries as possible.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2004, FSS has been instrumental in augmenting promotional campaigns of more than 2,540 films from the whole of Europe. Almost 50% of these films have been sold to countries in overseas.\\\\n\\\\nFSS complements EFP’s (European Film Promotion’s) manifold pan-European promotion initiatives.

The Shanghai International Film Festival was recently cancelled and the Beijing International Film Festival was postponed to August 22; the latter therefore was not part of the current contract and call.\",\"finalResults\":\"The sales companies have successfully used FSS for their digital campaigns to promote a total of 166 finished and unfinished films from Europe to overseas buyers at 4 prominent international film festivals, 4 markets outside of Europe and 2 major online markets inside of Europe with an international outward reach (the European Film Market, EFM, and the Marché du Film in Cannes) in the contract period. This year, there were no requests to promote European films at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin and the HotDocs Documentary Film Festival in Toronto but this can change every year depending on the festivals\\\\u0027 selection. \\\\n\\\\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, the Shanghai International Film Festival was cancelled and the Beijing International Film Fesival postponed to August 22. \\\\n\\\\nThe trend to work on a \\\\u0027holistic\\\\u0027 digital basis has meanwhile become common business practise for European world sales companies, in particular when reaching out to buyers outside of Europe who have been restricting their travels due to the pandemic. Working together with Europe\\\\u0027s most prolific world sales companies and the exchange of intelligence results in providing EFP with first-hand information on the different markets and up-to-date buyers\\\\u0027 habits outside of Europe.\\\\n\\\\nWith FSS, the sales companies have the opportunity to refine the production of digital promotion material that appeals to buyers around the world and triggers online interest in the films on various levels. Most of the sales agents have heavily expanded on their social media activities and hired professional digital marekting companies.

The slate is composed of three feature films with a cinematographic pretension, and a one-off series targeted to television or platform audiences. Firstly, we present ‘Dismantling the elephant’, the first feature film by the young Catalan director, Aitor Echeverría, a family drama that addresses the issue of alcoholism as a point of conflict between a mother and a daughter.In this way, AMP continues to promote new creative talent by supporting new directors. The second feature of AMPS is 'The secret of the Magi', written and directed by Nacho Sánchez Quevedo and Javier Dampierre in what will also be their first adventure in the world of animation. A 3D animated film whose protagonists, the Three Wise Men, will conquer children's audiences around the world, and will serve to boost the animation industry in Spain. Thirdly, we highlight the one-off series ‘Ravalear’ by Pol Rodriguez. A story that is born from the most personal family drama to encompass a project in the form of a thriller that will reflect the multicultural, social, and political reality that takes place in one of the most emblematic neighbourhoods of Barcelona, the Raval. Finally, AMPS includes the feature film ‘She saves the children’, a biopic narrated under the creative freedom of its authors, to tell us the story of Eglantyne Jebb, the founder of the international NGO Save the children. The project is a high value production that will be shot entirely in English, shooted mainly in Ireland and will have an international well-known casting. This will be an most ambitious production of AMPS, and we once again trust director Ibon Cormenzana to lead this project with such a personal take.\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053145'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-DEVSLATE'], 'overallBudget': ['235000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":899755608,\"legalName\":\"ARCADIA MOTION PICTURES SL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"08005\",\"street\":\"CIUDAD DE GRANADA 45, 1-1\",\"city\":\"Barcelona\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"41.370449300000004\",\"longitude\":\"2.1500219563810696\",\"activityType\":\"Private for profit organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"235000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['AMPS'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:17.544+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053145/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053145/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['235000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:17.453+0200'], 'topicId': ['44001627'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053145'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-08-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053149', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053149/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'IndieLisboa International Film Festival', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'IndieLisboa International Film Festival', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'B574F4898E9AAE2A8CAD77CB01646FF5CA17F40F599C195378A163F6CD2BD1F0', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:18.750+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-09-06T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['IndieLisboa International Film Festival'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053149_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Festival Catalogue 2022\",\"description\":\"Electronic (available on website) and printed (aprox. 5000 copies); Portuguese and English; aprox. 80 pages\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"IndieLisboa – International Film Festival 2022, 19th Edition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-05-30\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ebdb8640/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101053149_3_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Festival Catalogue 2023\",\"description\":\"Electronic (available on website) and printed (aprox. 5000 copies); Portuguese and English; aprox. 80 pages\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"IndieLisboa – International Film Festival 2023, 20th Edition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-09-27\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5faebab58/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['B574F4898E9AAE2A8CAD77CB01646FF5CA17F40F599C195378A163F6CD2BD1F0'], 'objective': ['IndieLisboa International Film Festival focuses on the exhibition of works that fill the void of film circulation shaped by the mainstream production and exhibition dominating the market.

The festival also aims to draw a spotlight on the discovery of Portuguese recent films through its national competitions and industry-oriented activities.  IndieLisboa is also a festival that focuses on a program designed specifically for the industry (audience of film professionals, filmmakers, producers, sales agents, programmers, critics, etc.). This industry core, parallel to the screenings program, is composed of workshops, masterclasses, debates, a script-writing lab, a film fund, a pitching forum, screenings of works in progress and also several networking events, among other activities.

Our 1st edition happened in 2004 and our programming grew in scale, offering a more diversified offer over the years, adding our IndieJúnior section in 2005 with the intent to work on young audiences development, and other sections as Industry, IndieMusic and its relation to IndieyNight, and we always aim to expand even further, establishing new partnerships every year.\\\\n\\\\nIndieLisboa focuses on bringing independent cinema closer to the audiences and on the organisation and promotion of film literacy initiatives. The festival shows mostly European works in competitions of both young and renowned directors, with concerned emphasis on countries with low levels of film production. Our organisation shows films that do not reach the regular distribution circuit, thus filling a gap that largely diversifies national cultural offer. The festival is also a platform to premiere and release new films, thus an important ally for Portuguese distributors. The festival fosters cultural and linguistic diversity by diversifying its geographical scope (in 2022 we showed films from 28 MEDIA countries, including 78 films from low audiovisual capacity countries. In 2023 edition\\\\u0027s we showed films from 25 MEDIA countries, including 125 films from low audiovisual capacity countries)\\\\n\\\\nWe continue to work on the growth of film literacy activities for younger audiences by expanding the range of partner schools and universities throughout the country and by offering diversified workshops throughout the school year. To the greatest extent, IndieLisboa aims to draw the spotlight to European productions and also to the discovery of Portuguese recent films (and also works in progress) through its competitions and industry oriented activities. Activities beyond regular screenings - workshops for children, workshops for film students, masterclasses, debates, new projects labs, a film fund, a pitching forum, screenings of works in progress, networking events, etc. – are our goal as we want to continue to expand the festival.  At the same time we continue to invest on a broad policy of invited guests, consistently supporting our mission.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In 2022, the 19th edition of IndieLisboa IFF registered 25.533 spectators, of which 24.296 in the theatre and 1.237 in online sessions for schools. The retrospective revisited the work of North-American director Doris Wishman, female pioneer in sexploitation production from the 60s. The focus of the Silvestre section celebrated the 40th anniversary of French distributor Light Cone, one of the great promoters of experimental cinema in France and in the world. Not to mention the return of IndiebyNight, the festival’s programme of parties and concerts, after two editions in pause. And also the IndieJúnior school programme, that this year returned to the cinemas after two editions taking place only online. In 2022, the Industry+Talks program was reduced to the Lisbon Screenings and the LisbonTalks. The Lisbon Screenings, an activity meant to promote Portuguese cinema among foreign professionals and to whom participation is restricted, continued to take place solely online. The LisbonTalks was dedicated to the new waves, sub-genres and ways of making cinema. \\\\n\\\\nIn 2023, the edition celebrating 20 years of IndieLisboa - International Film Festival marked the return to full-screen theatres and the pre-pandemic numbers of the festival, in an edition with 30 thousand spectators. Between April 27 and May 7, the film sessions occupied the usual venues of the festival plus 2 new venues. The retrospective \\\\\"Jan Švankmajer, The Surrealist\\\\\" revisited the work of one of the most interesting and indispensable living directors, born in Prague and owner of a restless art. The section Silvestre brought films dedicated to labour and trade union movement. Also of note is IndiebyNight, the festival\\\\u0027s programme of parties and concerts. For the Industry a program dedicated to film professionals that this year had five different activities: LisbonTalks by NOVA FCSH, Lisbon Screenings, Film Support Fund, IndieLab by NOVA FCSH and a Co-Production Forum, the latter two in their first edition. A new festival website was launched two months before the beginning of the edition. Finally, we highlight 2 new activities and a return to the festival. 2023 marked the first edition of IndieDate, a blind date at a film screening, and the Cinema at the Pool sessions with sessions for young and adult audiences that were all sold out. Mouth of Madness Marathon returned, after on hiatus since 2019. 7 consecutive hours of genre movies from 11pm to 6am.\",\"finalResults\":\"The 19th and 20th edition of IndieLisboa - International Film Festival were marked by the return of the festival to its original dates in Spring, after two years occupying the calendar at the end of Summer due to the pandemic. We saw in 2022 a slow return of people to movie theaters, but that in 2023 showed numbers very close to the pre-pandemic scenario. Between 2022 and 2023 we had an increase of almost 6000 viewers which is very significant. Two new activities have proven to be very successful among the public. On the one hand, the cinema sessions at the swimming pool, one of the novelties of the 20th edition, which sold out the 3 existing sessions, two of which for a family audience, for a total of 300 people. On the other hand, the novelty IndieDate a new experience for those who like surprises. A blind date during a film session, from a romantic date to a cinephile friendship.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral indicators show a continuous growth of the festival in the last two editions:\\\\n\\\\n- Higher number of films submitted (+9%)\\\\n- More spectators (+17%)\\\\n- More children, young people and families (+14%)\\\\n- Increase in the number of accredited and film professionals (398 in 2022 and 616 in 2023)\\\\n\\\\nIn 2023 we launched a new website, a major development in the last 2 years, more modern and intuitive and with a better user experience design.\\\\n\\\\nAs planned, we created in 2022, \\\\\"Cinema de Colo\\\\\", a special program during the festival aimed at the youngest of audiences, babies from 4 up tp 36 months, reinforcing our aim to work on audience development at very young ages.

The workshop includes interactive lectures, up-to-date case studies, group work sessions and many networking opportunities. Additionally, in an Expert Speed-Dating session, participants had the exclusive chance to discuss their current projects with various experts.\\\\n\\\\nOur workshop Digital Distribution – Maximizing Reach and Revenues took place in December 2022 in Berlin. The aim of the workshop – to offer information on the newest trends, relevant players, digital platforms and tools as well as hands-on advice and guidance to maximize reach and revenue as well as strategies for resourceful marketing and successful audience engagement – was successfully achieved through the participation of six experienced lecturers, The 16 participants from 12 European countries not only learned best practices through case studies, and received updates on new tools, B2B and B2C marketing strategies for different kinds of digital distribution but were also tasked to create a fictional digital marketing and distribution strategy in group work sessions.\\\\n\\\\nOur long-running workshop European Co-Production: Legal and Financial Aspects took place at the beginning of March 2023. The 20 participants from 14 countries took a deep dive into the topic of European co-productions, with sessions ranging from project financing and the legal framework to case studies of recent European co-productions. The eight experts joined from five European countries, and were not only available to the participants during their sessions, but also joined the many networking opportunities, allowing for even more exchange.\\\\n\\\\nA new addition were the compact online seminars on the topics Virtual Production, AI: Ethics and Legal Aspects and Greening the Industry.\\\\n\\\\nAI: Ethics and Legal Aspects was the first of the online seminars, taking place in May 2022. The experts Niklas Maamar (Legal Researcher) and Ramak Molavi Vasse´i (Digital Rights Lawyer and Innovation Law Expert) offered participants an overview on the current state of AI and broke down the most important legal and ethical aspects. Participants were also introduced to useful AI applications for the audiovisual industry, such as Largo and Limecraft.\\\\n\\\\nThe online seminar Virtual Production took place in June 2022. The goal of the seminar was to introduce professionals to the different kinds of virtual production, the basics of how to run a virtual production and when and where the technology presents a key asset to state-of-the-art content production. Lectures by Evgeny Kalachikhin (Art Director \\\\u0026 VP Supervisor) and Louisa Bremner (Virtual Production Supervisor) provided participants with a deeper understanding of virtual production and its possibilities and challenges. Case studies of recent productions that included virtual production made the technology more tangible for the attending professionals.\\\\n\\\\nThe last online seminar was Greening the Industry which took place in September 2022. The seminar offered audiovisual professionals helpful strategies and tools to make their productions more environmentally friendly and showed that sustainability and economic success do not have to be mutually exclusive. Acclaimed experts such as Roser Canela Mas shared their knowledge and by including case studies of the Polish low budget productions THE MOTHS (D: Piotr Stasik) and LIPSTICK ON THE GLASS (D: Kuba Czekaj), participants learned that it is possible to make an impact even on a small scale.\\\\n\\\\nThe eTraining Green Production was released in April 2023. It was produced with the help of five international experts who have much experience in the field of sustainable productions. The experts of the eTraining are coming from five different European countries, representing a wide range of perspectives. Among the experts are Anne Puolanne (Audiovisual Producers Finland APFI), Louise Marie Smith (Neptune Sustainability) and Roman Russo (Green Toolkit) and they cover everything from politics and regulations, and standards, initiatives and tools in Europe to collaborations with funders and broadcasters and case studies of sustainable productions.\",\"finalResults\":\"It is difficult to already describe the results and impact of the activities since some of them only took place a few months ago, therefore it is not possible to already see long-term results.

The CEEA Forum includes a pitching competition, 1:1 meetings and an industry programme. It consists of a sizable event in the Czech Republic and two regional events in Croatia and Slovenia. CEEA Experience is a series of masterclasses that presents current trends and strategies to national and regional communities of professionals. A less visible, but even more important activity is CEEA Bricks which aims to encourage financiers in the CEE region to be more proactive in favour of animation. Another output will be a guide aimed at more closely acquainting people and organisations with the animation industry of the CEE region. CEEA Talents works with young talents and aims to present their creativity to general audiences in addition to other film professionals. We target the development of new innovation - in particular helping young authors by creating two support regional programmes (Forum), encouraging the engagement of CEE film funds and broadcasters (Bricks) and expanding the support programme of debuting authors (Talents).'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053179'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-MARKETNET'], 'overallBudget': ['252500'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":897529749,\"legalName\":\"CEE ANIMATION EHZS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"150 00\",\"street\":\"NA DOUBKOVE 2040/8\",\"city\":\"PRAHA 5\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"CZ\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Czechia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.0756334\",\"longitude\":\"14.4062009\",\"activityType\":\"Private for profit organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"51000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938951853,\"legalName\":\"ASOCIACE ANIMOVANEHO FILMU ZS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"170 00\",\"street\":\"HERMANOVA 413/3\",\"city\":\"PRAHA 7\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"CZ\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Czechia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.0998276\",\"longitude\":\"14.4228633\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"36000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938264317,\"legalName\":\"DRUSTVO SLOVENSKEGA ANIMIRANEGA FILMA\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"1000\",\"street\":\"KERSNIKOVA ULICA 12\",\"city\":\"Ljubljana\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SI\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Slovenia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"46.0563035\",\"longitude\":\"14.5040999\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"30000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":3,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938223674,\"legalName\":\"STOWARZYSZENIE PRODUCENTOW POLSKIEJ ANIMACJI\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"02-595\",\"street\":\"UL PULAWSKA 61\",\"city\":\"WARSZAWA\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"PL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Poland\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"52.1978644\",\"longitude\":\"21.0241935\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"15000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":4,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":947636942,\"legalName\":\"HULAHOP DOO ZA FILMSKU PRODUKCIJU IUSLUGE\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"10 000\",\"street\":\"VLASKA ULICA 79\",\"city\":\"Zagreb\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"HR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Croatia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.788324700000004\",\"longitude\":\"15.933813568165476\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"15000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":5,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":true},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938329986,\"legalName\":\"ASOCIACIA PRODUCENTOV ANIMOVANEHO FILMU\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"900 85\",\"street\":\"VISTUK 277\",\"city\":\"VISTUK\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SK\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Slovakia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.3343451\",\"longitude\":\"17.38809489132994\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"4500\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":6,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['CEEA SIP'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

The main topics included immersive and multimodal storytelling, co-creation methodologies, impact and outreach strategies. We inspired our participants to find new ways to develop participatory projects that include the audience from the early stages, crossing borders between documentary and fiction and finding unusual and surprising ways of storytelling, be it in short or long forms. Participants worked on their impact strategies, elaborating on their target audience. At the end of Phase 1, participants received mentoring on their projects, building on the inputs they collected during Phase 1.\\\\nThe focus of Phase 2 - which stretched on several online sessions - was on assessing the experimentation started before, strengthening and condensing it into a coherent and feasible outline. Participants refined the storytelling format of their projects and got more practical tools to further develop their impact strategy. In preparation for the pitching in Phase 3, we also held a two-part masterclass on teasers: in the first, participants received thorough comments and feedback on their materials, and re-elaborated their teaser for the second meeting. Between Phase 2 and 3, participants had a second round of mentoring, focused on preparing their visual and written materials for the pitch. \\\\nPhase 3 focused on the participants’ presentation skills and supporting them in the preparation of a “recorded pitch” and a “traditional pitch”, including a pitch deck composed of a short 2-page presentation of their project, a longer and more detailed written presentation and the visual elements (e.g. teaser, prototype). \\\\nIn the first online part participants joined group sessions where they discussed and refined the content, the rhythm and the structure of their presentation; they worked on their body language and their mindset in a pitching situation in one-to-one meetings. At the end of the online phase, participants produced an “online pitch deck”. \\\\nThe residential part took place in Vilnius in partnership with Inconvenient Film Festival. The first days we provided our participants with focused coaching sessions for the live setting. During the course of two mornings, all projects developed at ESoDoc were presented in front of an international panel of experts. In the afternoons, our participants had the chance to meet the panellists in one-to-one meetings to follow up on their presentations. We organised an Industry Day, in partnership with the Creative Europe Desk Lithuania, opening to the public masterclasses and lectures about the workshop’s themes (crossmedia; short formats; impact; unconscious bias). \\\\nIn Phase 4 (Follow-up) we delivered practical masterclasses on specific industry-related topics (international co-productions, distribution and festival strategies), followed by one-to-one meetings with the experts to discuss practical implementation onto their projects. We also organised a series of presentations of film-industry institutions (IDM film commission; Voice of America) and EU-supported training dok.incubator, as well as an informative session to present the various opportunities offered by Creative Europe. We used the “online pitch deck” to organise matchmaking sessions with various producers available through the ESoDoc network.

Owing to their post-translational mode of import, mitochondrial precursor proteins explore the cytosol before they are imported into mitochondria. These reactions are of utmost importance for cellular functionality since cytosolic precursors pose a major threat of cellular proteostasis and are major drivers in aging and for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the biology of cytosolic precursors is largely elusive.\\nIn vitro import assays governed the experimentation platform of the mitochondrial community which enabled exquisite breakthroughs in understanding translocation, but are unsuited to elucidate cytosolic reactions. MitoCyto aims to break out of these experimental walls to elucidate the biology of cytosolic precursors with an interdisciplinary research team that leaves the comfort zone of biochemistry to utilize genetic and cell biology approaches but also develops novel cutting-edge techniques from high throughput approaches, through microfluidics-assisted microscopy to synthetic biology. From this innovative combination, detailed mechanistic insights into three so far largely elusive aspects of cell biology will be possible for the first time: (1) What are the cytosolic interactors of mitochondrial precursor proteins? (2) What are the direct and indirect physiological consequences of cytosolic precursor accumulation? (3) How does the re-routing of mitochondrial proteins to the nucleus control growth and fitness of eukaryotic cells?\\nWe are convinced that MitoCyto will break grounds to a comprehensive understanding of how eukaryotic cells maintain a healthy proteome over a lifetime despite fluctuating metabolic conditions.

They conquered Eurasia along a rapid “Out of Africa” movement but left Europe empty during almost 1 million years. Western Europe did indeed face environmental constraints. This subcontinent is in a remote corner of Eurasia but other large Eurasian peninsulas are dead-ends as well. Certainly, Western Europe mixture of various environments and topographies did change a lot over time and the succession of climates, then causing favorable territories for human occupations to fluctuate. However, archaeology in Asia and the Levant shows that hominins did overcome variable climatic conditions and geographies.\\nInvestigating why Western Europe have remained out of the “Oekoumen” for so long is our research proposal LATEUROPE, that we base over datasets of interdisciplinary and behavioral materials enriched by future fieldworks in several specific sites and biomes on the key period before 500 ka. This will question at the local, regional and continental scale, the environmental, geographic and climatic conditions of Europe as compared to the rest of Eurasia and the characteristics of the hominin occupations and behaviours, or/and if a minimum degree of cognition was required to thrive in these lands. Databases will input multiple scenarios combining migration patterns and internal evolution mechanisms, using conceptual modeling and spatial agent-based simulations. This formalized combination of modeling and field methodologies is an epistemological advance for bringing interdisciplinarity to reality, allowing us to deeply question the ability of Homo species to adapt themselves to harsh environments, to face environmental shocks and changes on a long term scale. \\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052653'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2558250'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999997930,\"legalName\":\"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75794\",\"street\":\"RUE MICHEL ANGE 3\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8476256\",\"longitude\":\"2.2640027\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"2558250\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['LATEUROPE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:54.141+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052653/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052653/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2558250'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-09-27T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:54.125+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101052653'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2023-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052699', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052699/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'BERGMAN ISLAND', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'BERGMAN ISLAND', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '6552998FD36837152788A56F7887A6CA256DA0DD828C170552A3DBFE849006A5', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:01:56.429+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['BERGMAN ISLAND'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101052699_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Bande-annonce\",\"description\":\"Trailer du film\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project coordination and sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-06-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5eddd5635/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052699_2_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Affiche\",\"description\":\"Poster du film\",\"code\":\"Other\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project coordination and sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-06-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5eddd5732/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['6552998FD36837152788A56F7887A6CA256DA0DD828C170552A3DBFE849006A5'], 'objective': [\"Kinology, agent de ventes internationales depuis 2008 présente ici un groupe de 20 distributeurs chevronnés prévoyant de sortir le film Bergman Island de Mia Hansen-Love dans 24 pays éligibles MEDIA entre l'automne 2021 et 2022.

These are experienced distributors which have been supporting independent cinema, particularly European, for years. Many of them have been supporting Mia Hansen-Love\\\\u0027s films for a long time. These distribution companies were therefore familiar with Mia Hansen-Love\\\\u0027s unique universe and, from the market launch at Cannes 2018, were particularly excited by the film. Several distributors actually pre-bought the film at the script stage. Others made their offers after seeing the first images of the film, presented a year later at Cannes 2019. The film has been sold in most of the World (Kinology has the rights in the World excluding co-producing countries), through a very effective pre-sales strategy, then via targeted taylor-made marketing campaign and thanks to the selection of the film in Official Competition at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. BERGMAN ISLAND is a true European work, produced in France, shot in Sweden (mostly), a French-Swedish-German-Benelux coproduction, with a strong international potential. Beyond the European production of the picture, it appeared quite natural to think the whole life of the film as a European project, including its distribution all around theatres in Europe .\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Kinology took care of gathering the distributors in order to create a pan-European strategy around the film, allowing us to pool marketing elements (poster, trailer, press campaign) and ideas around the release of the film. Kinology has thus set up several tools for distributors to brainstorm and share their strategies: breakfast in Cannes, zoom meeting, WhatsApp group. Ideas emerged and were exchanged around a few key themes for the film\\\\u0027s release: beyond the European filmgoers who already appreciate the director\\\\u0027s work, the possibility of accompanying the release with a Bergman and/or Mia Hansen-Love retrospective, or events linked to Sweden and Bergman to attract fans, but also mobilisation around the feminist theme (as it is a film written and directed by a woman, which speaks precisely about writing and film-making by a woman, and thus about the place of women in film-making. The film was released in France on July 14th 2021 and theatrical releases in the rest of the World are still going from then with most European releases taking place in winter/spring 2022. \\\\nIn Cannes, we also organised a « press junket » so that distributors (even those who could not attend the festival) could benefit from press coverage in the local media: interviews with the director and cast, in-depth articles on Bergman\\\\u0027s legacy or new French women directors, etc. Kinology, in collaboration with the producer and the distributor in France, brought the entire film team (including Tim Roth) to Cannes, paying for the cast\\\\u0027s plane tickets. We hired a special camera crew to allow filmed interviews for the international press. The presence of the cast at the Cannes Film Festival not only gave European journalists access to unavailable talent (who would not be able to travel for every local release) but also provided a great pan-European communication tool, allowing the film to reach the audience in the World. European press articles derived from Cannes screenings and press junket allowed the film to start its public communication campaign throughout Europe.\",\"finalResults\":\"All the work done with regards to European sales and coordination between distributors allowed the film to have a great press coverage in Europe, and to efficiently plan ambitious marketing campaigns in each of the MEDIA territories (based on \\\\\"international materials\\\\\" created by Kinology or by exchanged local posters and trailers between European distributors).\\\\nHowever, several ambitious ideas born from the above-mentionned coordinated activities could not be carried out eventually, particularly because of the situation of independent cinema in Europe (situation worsened by the rebound of the COVID epidemic from November/December 2021): distributors had to face the difficulties for independent films to attract audience and then had to reduce the P\\\\u0026A costs initially envisaged, in view of the possible revenues expected and to a certain extent constrained by the profitability imperative.\\\\nDespite fluctuations of the COVID situation, all distributors decided to stick with their convictions and favour a theatrical release rather that a digital release for this film.

La mission de cet Atelier est aussi d’apprendre aux participants à développer en commun une commande de production.\\\\nLa formation se déroule en France, en Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni, de début octobre à fin août.

Cette année, l’écriture et le développement du film ENTRE LES VAGUES, porté par le duo de la réalisatrice Anaïs Volpé et de la productrice Caroline Nataf, a permis à l\\\\u0027Atelier de rencontrer une jeune productrice, qui produit aussi bien des documentaires que des fictions, défendant dans ce cas le 2ème film d\\\\u0027une jeune réalisatrice. En parallèle la présentation du film ONODA, pour montrer la diversité de la production française, a permis à l\\\\u0027Atelier de rencontrer le producteur Nicolas Anthomé, qui a porté pendant des années le projet d\\\\u0027un jeune réalisateur français, Arthur Harari, pour donner vie à un film entièrement tourné en décor naturel à l\\\\u0027étranger, en langue japonaise, grâce à de multiples partenaires de coproduction. Autour de ces deux études de cas, se sont construites des interventions avec des financeurs publics et privés, des distributeurs, des vendeurs et des diffuseurs, réunissant les différents partenaires de financement d\\\\u0027un film, encadrées par des interventions ponctuelles sur le contexte de la production et l\\\\u0027économie du cinéma en France. \\\\nDans le cadre de cette session, une participation au Festival du Court-Métrage de Clermont-Ferrand a été l’occasion de découvrir un large panorama de courts-métrages français et étrangers, portés par de jeunes réalisateurs émergents. Les étudiants ont profité de cette manifestation à taille humaine pour rencontrer des réalisateurs et des producteurs, formaliser des contacts déjà noués et sceller de futures collaborations avec les professionnels du secteur. \\\\nAprès un passage à la Berlinale, la session de Londres s\\\\u0027est tenue du 21 février au 4 mars, mise en place en collaboration avec le département production de la NFTS, en présence de leurs étudiants de 2ème année ainsi que les étudiants production de 2ème année de La Fémis. Elle a permis d\\\\u0027appréhender de l’intérieur le système de production et de distribution britannique et d’en saisir les spécificités, que ce soit en matière d\\\\u0027écriture ou de financement, par rapport au système européen. Les évolutions du secteur toujours au cœur des interventions de la formation, ont abordé l’avenir et les enjeux de l’industrie du streaming et mis l’accent sur les méthodes et les logiques de la production financée par les nouvelles plateformes de diffusion.\\\\nLors de cette première session, les participants ont rencontré les scénaristes de La Fémis ayant répondu à l\\\\u0027appel à projets pour choisir les trois scénarios que chacun des trois duos produira en France.

Ces stages permettent aux participants de mieux connaître, en immersion et sur une courte durée, les activités menées par des sociétés avec lesquelles ils seront amenés à collaborer en tant que futurs producteurs. Les métiers de la distribution et des ventes internationales attirent parfois certains qui rejoignent les rangs des structures dans lesquelles ils ont fait leur stage. De plus, l\\\\u0027environnement international, dynamique et hautement compétitif du Marché du Film du Festival de Cannes est un lieu idéal pour se confronter à ces métiers exigeants, sans cesse en évolution.\\\\nPar ailleurs, ces stages revêtent un double objectif : mieux connaître les domaines de la distribution et des ventes internationales, proches partenaires de la production, et développer leur réseau professionnel. Leurs compétences relationnelles et professionnelles sont également testées dans les environnements très différents dans lesquelles ils sont amenés à faire leur stage : structure de grande ampleur disposant de nombreux services en interne et d\\\\u0027un nombre de collaborateurs conséquent, ou petite société au fonctionnement plus familial, où les tâches peuvent être plus diversifiées et impliquer davantage de responsabilités. Cette année encore les stages auront lieu dans les trois pays du programme - France, Allemagne, Grande-Bretagne - mais aussi en Espagne dans le pays d\\\\u0027origine de l\\\\u0027une des participants.\\\\nCes stages permettent également de faire connaître l\\\\u0027Atelier au sein des structures et par ce biais au sein de l\\\\u0027industrie plus en général. Chaque année des jeunes gens employés dans ces entreprises de distribution et de ventes contactent l\\\\u0027Atelier pour connaître les conditions d\\\\u0027admission et se porter candidat à la future édition de la formation.\\\\nC\\\\u0027est aussi dans le cadre de cette 1ère session que se créent les liens avec les étudiants des écoles partenaires.

À l\\\\u0027heure où le public international manifeste une grande appétence pour le cinéma de patrimoine, où les débouchés s’élargissent avec la multiplication des canaux et formules de diffusion, et où, dans le même temps, les technologies, les pratiques de consommation des images et l’environnement réglementaire sont en pleine mutation, le MIFC a pour mission de fédérer, de structurer et de renseigner cette filière au niveau européen et international pour dynamiser son économie, favoriser la promotion et la diffusion de ses œuvres et assurer la diversité du patrimoine cinématographique européen. Une fois par an, à l’occasion du festival Lumière qui célèbre le cinéma classique, le MIFC rassemble pendant 4 jours tous les professionnels de la chaîne de cette industrie dans un lieu dédié, et leur propose : des débats éditorialisés en prise directe avec l’actualité juridique, technique, politique, économique de la filière, des datas, des études de cas et des ateliers, des projections mais aussi des espaces de travail propices au BtoB, ainsi que des rendez-vous conviviaux favorisant les rapprochements. Le MIFC, facilitateur de rencontres et entremetteur de projets, a pour objectif de développer les échanges commerciaux - qu’il s’agisse de vente de droits, d’accords de diffusion ou de prestations techniques ou de services -, de présenter des pratiques innovantes exportables, de contribuer à la définition de nouveaux modèles économiques dynamiques et vertueux.

The objective of Hulahop’s mini slate was to strengthen Hulahop’s position on both the regional and European market. Our aim was to  lay foundations for co-productions with companies from countries with different production capacities, increase the visibility of the company and its projects on film festivals and markets, as well as increase the number and ambition of projects in development.\\\\n\\\\nTriumphs of Modernism deal with some of the most daring and important architectural feats of the Yugoslavian regime. Architecture was used as a means to represent the new, open, Non-Aligned Yugoslav society. The series in its 4 episodes takes us to Zagreb, Belgrade, Zenica, Sarajevo, and a small Belgian city of Wevelgem. In those cities, we explore how architecture represented the foundations of the Yugoslav society: federative state, non-alignment, modernisation, and antifascism. In the series we feature buildings, monuments, and cities that embodied those ideals. Through the stories of abandoned architecture, we explore the abandoned social ideas in order to raise awareness about the European tangible and intangible cultural/social heritage and the need for its preservation. Our goal was to develop and produce high-quality TV content, increase its visibility, marketability, and dissemination potential in order to be competitive in the international market and reach wider audiences.\\\\n\\\\nEuropean Union Wolf takes us to Bukovica, a small Croatian region near the Adriatic coast. Bukovica is socially isolated and completely unattractive to tourists that spend their time on the beaches. There, people live from their sheep and goat herds. However, wolves started coming, killing the herds and creating big problems for the villagers. The villagers have no doubt - the Croatian government, in an agreement with Brussels, systematically populates the area with wolves, flying them from abroad with helicopters. Their goal is simple - to disperse the local population and make space for new industries. Through the main character, Ana, a vet who doesn’t believe in the conspiracy, we will show how people who are systematically neglected find their reasoning in a theory that is completely unreasonable. We aimed at developing a film that, thanks to its highly relevant and universal theme, has a potential for international cinema, TV, and festival distribution. Since topics of ecology, preservation of nature, wolf protection, and isolated rural communities are currently trending in many European countries, we aimed to develop the film as a European co–production. Utilising that strategy, we increased the film’s visibility through international pitchings, workshops, and market attendance.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Triumphs of Modernism started with the development in September 2021. Our primary focus in development was finding archives, locations and partners outside of Croatia as well as securing financing for the shoot, which we confiremd in December 2021. Throughout the first half of 2022, we went on 8 location scouts in order to find relevant protagonists, sites, and other necessary material that enabled us to finish the scripts and prepare for the shoot. We participated at the Sunny Side of the Doc market in La Rochelle, which resulted in securing a sales agent (TVF International). We are very close to concluding the deal which will enable the series to reach an international audience. In addition, we visited one of the most important regional TV markets - NEM Dubrovnik in order to find pre-sales for the series. We managed to successfully shoot the series and deliver it to Croatian Radiotelevision in August 2023.\\\\n\\\\nThe development of European Union Wolf started with two training/pitching forums - Astra Film Lab 2021 and DocLisboa Nebulae 2021. Those two pitches were crucial in further refinement of the story arc and establishing the key female protagonist. Identifying the antipode to the main protagonist (Draja who represents the superstitious worldview) was the key to the increase of the dramatic potential of the story. He was found during the research shoot in February 2022. The project was further developed during three sessions of ExOriente training programme. The input received during the training followed by a final research shoot in September 2022 resulted in created assemblies for each of the film’s protagonists and understanding of their dramatic role in the final film.We have confirmed co-producers in Serbia, REZON Inkubator, with whom we have successfully applied and secured  funds of the Film Centre Serbia. Besides additional funding, this co-production is key to the easier access to distribution in Serbia.

Spanning diverse talents, perspectives, genres and budgets, the slate is unified by its exploration of socially pertinent issues. The Gut is a WW2 story told from a colonised, female and queer perspective. 2nd time writer-director Rebecca Cremona’s aim is to reclaim history by depicting real members of the marginalised entertainment communities whose contribution to the war effort has been largely forgotten. The Crusaders is a contemporary story of an American visiting the ‘Old World’, only to find a bitcoin culture and fractured society which he explores through a connection forged with an immigrant from Niger.  Directing duo Magdalena Zyzak (Poland) and Zachary Cotler (US) are in the unique position of telling this semi-autobiographical story. Moo is a universally appealing family film set in locally specific Gozo, centred around an 11-year old activist in the vein of Greta Thunberg. Written by multi-award winning environment economist Marie Briguglio, this important story is at once timeless and timely. Moondance, is a magic realist short by emerging writer director Ryan Gatt, which taps into Maltese traditions to spin a mythological story of a woman allergic to sunlight who is ostracised by her insular town.  Established in 2010, Kukumajsa is a pioneer of Malta’s fledgling indigenous film industry. We have Malta’s first ever Oscar submission under our belt, as well as a DGA and EMMY awarded short; we've collaborated with companies from high audiovisual capacity countries in above-the-line capacities and have produced one of few existing Maltese literature short film adaptations.

We know that by structuring meaningful financial plans to match the narrative scope and production values of each of these projects, we have an opportunity to build a creative and production hub in the CEE region where the sum of the projects’ parts will lead to a much more influential whole.\\\\nIn this application we have a German-Hungarian drama, BALATON BRIGADE, set entirely in Hungary. It’s built around topics and themes very common to the two countries, dissecting a painful, but also, from many respects joyous, era in our shared history. \\\\nWAR OF SAINTS is a very different proposition. It’s set entirely in Italy, depicting a narrative that is thoroughly Italian, but the chief creator is Hungarian. With the religious conflict arising in a small, much suffering town of Santocielo, Eszter is reaching deep into her own unique experiences, doubts and emotions as a Hungarian once living in Italy, to tell a universal story of faith, love and sacrifice. \\\\nFor both projects we have found partners in the respective countries who appreciate and share our vision. These are all stories stemming from a Hungarian emotional core, but the strong reaction from our European partners and the victories at international pitching events indicate that they resonate well beyond our borders.\\\\nApplying for the slate funding we were hoping to be able to reach the next stage of development: involve other main creatives; and start the process of finding the actors who will turn the characters into real persons; and locations which transform the imaginary world into reality. With finding the unique identity, it becomes more easier to move on to the next, the most important stage of every series project: the actual realization.\\\\nThe other goal was to make the projects more attractive for potential financiers, broadcasters, and streaming platforms.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Balaton Brigade\\\\nDuring the past year we have been able to make a leap forward in terms of development. We created an international writer’s room with a highly talented writer from Germany joining the Hungarian team. \\\\nThis was preceded by a long search for a writer who not only shares our passion for the project but can meaningfully contribute with his or her experiences from the era. This careful research led us to Arne Kohlweyer, an author and screenwriter who was born behind the Iron Curtain himself and brought his own experiences to the writers room. \\\\nTogether with him and the original creators of the project we spent three months together in Budapest and ultimately managed to rewrite the pilot episode and write three more episodes, leading to 4 scripts out of the 8 in the first season. \\\\nThe development also involved engaging a historical consultant. The lead director, Ildikó Enyedi also joined the work and provided her own take on the writing. \\\\nParallel to this process, we managed to scout for and find a second director to the project from Germany. Lennart Ruff is a great addition to the creative team, bringing his outstanding expertise in helming high budget series to the table. His younger perspective and more commercial driven approach keep proving to be invaluable to complement Ildikó Enyedi’s more arthouse oriented style. \\\\nTogether they also started working on the casting. With the help of casting agent Anja Dihrberg, an arduous process began. We’ve managed to secure the interest of two top German acting talents, Ulrich Matthes and August Diehl. Their love for the project and the creative package ensured that they are committed to be on board.\\\\n\\\\nWar of Saints\\\\nWe were first and foremost focusing on the story development. We worked on the rewrite of the already existing material but also moved on with the story with writing the next episode. \\\\nWe conducted interviews with different director candidates until we find the one who seemed the most adequate fit to the project.  After that, we could start the casting process – first with the scouting of talents, then narrowing them down to the ones who seemed to fit the director’s and the creator’s ideas about the specific characters. We also realized it is necessary to translate the scripts into Italian – the actual shooting language of the series -to help the work of our Italian partners.\\\\nLocation scouting: the story actually leaves some space for exploration: the only thing we knew for sure was that it must be shot in South-Italy.\\\\nAfter considering the different options, we’ve chosen the region of Puglia as the ideal location. We reached out to the Apuglia Film Fund who were enthusiastic about the project and offered access to their database. With their help we managed to narrow down the search to the province of Foggia, in the Puglia region, where we can find all our necessary locations.\",\"finalResults\":\"Balaton Brigade: The parallel processes described above have led to a strong, international quality package that our partners, Newen Connect and Flare Entertainment have been able to use to drum up interest in the project by the major players. As we took out the project to the market, in the first half of the year seismic changes shook the global industry. With the shares of Netflix plummeting and the Discovery-Warner Media merger decimating the original programming efforts at HBO Max in Europe, the outlook for high end drama series especially in the low production capacity countries in the CEE region does not look so rosy. However, the team behind the project continue to have strong faith in BALATON BRIGADE, so we are moving on to pitching to traditional broadcasters and platforms. Our firm conviction is that it is only a matter of time until we find the right partner to greenlight this remarkable and truly unique drama series project.\\\\n\\\\nWar of Saints: We managed to move on with the story development by reworking the story of the season, rewriting the pilot episode and writing the second episode of the series. We also translated the pilot episode into Italian. We enlarged our creative team with attaching director Beniamino Catena. With Catena, we were able to start the casting process, which is a major advantage in such an early development stage, as actors can have a huge impact on the characters. Not to mention their influence on selling the project to a major television network. With finding the province in Foggia as our main shooting location, we can see now way more clearly practical aspects of the shooting, and we could come up with a more specific and realistic production budget.  In Apuglia Film Commission, we found an invaluable long-term partner, who can help us throughout the whole process. We worked out in more details our existing action plans, modified our target groups and strategies.\\\\nAt the end we were able to create a unified creative vision for War of Saints – which is key to be successful in the actual realization of the project.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-08-12\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-10-11\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052844', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052844/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '04BE85E3F0EB972D3B3782D2903DE6CA55FF69A8302B2EF89A54D8750E20A868', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:14.168+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-11-11T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['AtomArt MiniSlate European Development Application'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['04BE85E3F0EB972D3B3782D2903DE6CA55FF69A8302B2EF89A54D8750E20A868'], 'objective': ['\"The main objective of “Atom Art Mini-Slate” is to expand the studio\\'s capacity by developing two projects - feature animated film “Born Happy” and animation series “Hello, Oscar!”. \\n\\nProject “Born Happy\"\" activities include managing the production process and working with co-production studios, as well as dialogue polishing, script translation, storyboarding, animatic development and market attendance.  “Hello, Oscar!” activities include script writing and editing, script translation, storyboard development, one animatic, character design and background design development and 3D object animation tests. \\n\\nThere are 14 people benefiting for both projects together - 8 will work in “Born Happy” and 12 will benefit in the project “Hello, Oskar!”.

The film project was pitched at CineLink Industry Days taking place during the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2022 where it received very positive feedback from industry representatives. The raising of financing was successfully done through bringing on board another co-production partner from Bulgaria and applications to the Film Centre of Serbia, HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) and Bulgarian National Film Centre and the joint application of all co-producers for EURIMAGES funding.\\\\nMinor adjustments and finetuning were made to the script of the film, which was already at the very advanced stage at the time of submission of the mini-slate application. In addition to that the location scouting trip took place resulting in a list of shooting locations. The casting process for both actors and creative team was carried out successfully resulting in an experienced and dedicated team ready for production of the film. \\\\n\\\\nFor the documentary “Nistru. The Irreversible Flow of Life” the main focus of the development stage was further script development as well as promotion of the film internationally. The research trip to Moldova took place in autumn 2021, and the next rounds of research trips was foreseen in February, May and September 2022. The schedule for research trips in 2022 was affected by the full-scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, heavily influencing life in the neighbouring Moldova. In February and March 2022 director and executive producer of the film were actively involved in helping Ukrainian refugees transiting Moldova. The further research trips with participation of the director and producer of the film took place in April and June 2022, and resulted in an updated version of the script. In 2022 the project was part of two important development workshops. The producer of the film participated in EURODOC 2022, which provided an excellent opportunity to receive feedback from the international documentary community, both the fellow filmmakers and industry representatives. During the last session of EURODOC in October 2022 the project was presented to a number of international industry representatives including broadcasters and film festivals, which showed very high interest in the project and also extended valuable feedback. In November 2022 the director of the film took part in IDFA Academy, which was an excellent opportunity to receive feedback both from industry professionals and other participants of the Academy. Following the feedback the decision was taken to change the storytelling approach of the film and to focus on telling the story through a couple of protagonists, instead of the collective protagonist. In 2023 the director continued to work on the new approach resulting in an updated script version with defined shooting locations and protagonists.  Given the changes in the script, the further applications for funding were put on hold but will recommence at the beginning of 2024. \\\\n\\\\nThe creative team of the documentary “Measuring the Sky” used the development process for research trips to Chile, USA and Italy working on securing the material with the main protagonist and casting the protagonists for secondary roles. The trips to the USA were focused on filming the main protagonist at his home and university in Seattle, filming the laboratory producing the camera for the observatory in Austin, Texas as well as interviews with top engineers at SpaceX, the company whose activities in space serve as the antagonism to the endeavours of the film\\\\u0027s main  protagonist and his colleagues. The research trips to Chile were focused on filming the observatory in anticipation of the camera, while in Italy the team followed the main protagonist to the annual congress of astronomers as well as to the Vatican Observatory and his meeting with Pope\\\\u0027s astronomer. \\\\nTo raise the financing for the film, funding applications were submitted to HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) attracting funding for development and production. The application for funding in Slovenia fail but by only a few points, so we will re-apply with an elaborated version of the project in September 2023.  The creative team also took part in the pitching forum at the When East Meets West in Trieste, Italy in January 2023 and received a lot of international interest.\",\"finalResults\":\"The support of Creative Europe MEDIA programme was instrumental in finalising the development stage of the the fiction film “Mama”. The film is now ready to go into production and the start of shooting is planned for October 2023, encompassing four shooting weeks and finalisation of the film in spring 2024. The project, which started as a collaboration between Croatia and Serbia is now a co-production of Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria. \\\\nThe cast comes from Serbia with Croatia bringing in talent for 3 side roles. The majority of the creative crew comes from Serbia, with Bulgaria bringing in talent for the sound and make-up department, and Croatia contributing with producer and executive producer roles. The funding of the film has been secured by national funding sources - Film Centre of Serbia, HAVC (Croatian Audiovisual Centre) and Bulgarian National Film Centre and EURIMAGES funding. \\\\n\\\\nFor the documentary “Nistru. The Irreversible Flow of Life” Creative Europe MEDIA support was channeled towards further story development and research, and the main result of the project was shift in the focus from telling the story with a collective protagonist to a few selected strong protagonists and updated script. The project is currently in the final stages of the development and we plan to start the principal photography in January 2024. We plan to finetune the script and move forward with applications for funding in co-production countries - Latvia, Croatia, Finland and Moldova in 2024 as well as applications for international funds, including DOHA Film Institute for post-production. We have been invited to the pitching forum of Visions du Reel but turned it down since we felt the project is not ready yet. Now we feel that in 2024 we could take our chance to present the new version of the film to the international audience. \\\\n\\\\nThanks to the support of Creative Europe MEDIA programs documentary “Measuring the Sky” has achieved considerable development progress both in terms of casting of protagonists, gaining access and development of the storyline. The one aspect holding us back from going into production full scale is postponing the central event of the film - delivery and launch of high-resolution camera from the USA to the observatory in Chile. It has been delayed twice, due to Covid-19 restrictions and unrest in Chile. Now the deadline for delivery has been postponed to the end of 2024, and we have adjusted our production schedule accordingly. The changes in the production schedule, however, has given us more time to raise the funding needed for the production stage and we will use this delay to our benefit.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-09-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-08-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052837', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052837/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': '\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': '\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'AB0DA9E0F53271DE52C572742FD19523D907D986D280DA93F6F4EBAD5BA74DBF', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:12.732+0200'], 'endDate': ['2025-05-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['\"Mini slate of next generation Bulgarian female auteur directors and their fiction feature film projects: “Nina”, “Cold”, “Love Will Tear Us a Part\"\"\"'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['AB0DA9E0F53271DE52C572742FD19523D907D986D280DA93F6F4EBAD5BA74DBF'], 'objective': ['RFF has a 25 year track record in the auteur film industry and is currently ramping up their productions after a series of pan-European successes.

The funding has shielded the company from external pressures, coming from political influences as well as economic ones caused by new market entrants. This has allowed us to remain independent and continue the company\\\\u0027s idea to develop projects that are diverse and inclusive, while supporting who are sensitive to contemporary issues and courageously express them, exploring new genres.\\\\n\\\\nSupport from MEDIA facilitated the inclusion of new development executive (Kaja Jałocha) into our team. This strategic move amplified the company\\\\u0027s competitiveness and allowed us to sustain a growing slate of projects. The Slate-supported resources have facilitated simultaneous development and production of both projects that were initially included in the proposal, propelling \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" to its 2024 shooting schedule and expecting the script finalization and financing/production package closure of \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE\\\\\" by the end of 2023.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In the context of \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE,\\\\\" a series of strategic actions have been undertaken, significantly contributing to the project\\\\u0027s progress. On a script development level, we engaged with Torino Film Lab and held consultations with Nadja Dumouchel during the Mastercard Off Camera festival (Krakow 2022). This collaboration helped us to gain international perspective on the project and its content matter. \\\\n\\\\nRegular script meetings were systematically held under the guidance of the Development Executive (Kaja Jalocha). These meetings focused on character development, genre specifics, thematic depth, and dramaturgical structure. This led to 8 drafts of the script, reflecting the project\\\\u0027s evolutionary process. Exploring scripts thematic relevance, political consultations were conducted with Member of Parliament Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, offering insights into contemporary sociopolitical aspects of Poland. \\\\n\\\\nA moodbook, which encapsulates the project\\\\u0027s visual and emotional tone, was prepared. Collaborative dialogues were established with essential partners: distributors, sales agents, and streaming platforms such as Netflix and Canal+, to strategize the project\\\\u0027s dissemination. The project\\\\u0027s significance extended due to inclusion in industry catalogs, namely Poles in Cannes and Poles in Berlin, enhancing its global visibility. The interest of potential director – Anna Kazejak – was also secured (LOI).\\\\n\\\\nThe developmental progression of \\\\\"SARA\\\\u0027S BUNGALOW\\\\\" included two versions of the treatment and four script drafts. A comprehensive moodbook containing visual and location references was assembled to establish the film\\\\u0027s thematic essence. Specialist script consultants, namely Aleksandra Świerk and Kaja Jałocha, were engaged to analyze and advise on the subsequent drafts. Further expertise was sought from Maggie Soboil, an American script consultant, who conducted tailored workshops with the director and screenwriter, concentrating on the emotional character development.\\\\n\\\\nThe selection of cinematographer was a strategic step. The process culminated in the shortlisting of following DoPs: Kate McCullough, Monika Lenczewska, and Mikołaj Syguda, with the latter chosen to be the DoP of the project. The production\\\\u0027s financial structure was prepared (finance plan, recoupment), detailed production budget was created with the input of a production manager, and a comprehensive shooting schedule was generated by a second assistant director based on the fourth draft of the script. \\\\n\\\\nDevelopment process involved an extensive casting process to identify the lead roles, resulting in the selection of Agata Kulesza as SARA and Dobromir Dymecki as INKAR. Another significant milestone was the production of a test scene, featuring the chosen lead actors, which effectively conveyed the narrative\\\\u0027s essence through a video mood trailer. Project’s relevance was confirmed by the international exposure through its participation in prominent European film industry events, including the EFM in Berlin, Eastern Promises Karlovy Vary (online format), and Galway Film Fleadh Market in Ireland (online format). SARAS BUNGALOW received Polish Film Instutite production grant and is scheduled to be shoot in spring 2024.\",\"finalResults\":\"The company aimed to fortify its foothold in the European market by channeling its resources towards strategic areas of script development and nurturing emerging talents.\\\\n\\\\nThrough the support of the Media Slate, SHIPSBOY has not only realized its core objectives but also transformed them into tangible achievements. The infusion of resources and support facilitated the parallel advancement of \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" and \\\\\"POLITICS OF LOVE,\\\\\" defying initial limitations. The financing of \\\\\"SARA’S BUNGALOW\\\\\" was successfully secured, with a slated shooting schedule set for the upcoming spring of 2024. The bolstered team, now including a dedicated Development Executive, has augmented the company\\\\u0027s competitiveness and nurtured an expanding network of talents.

It requires the removal of small regions of suspect tissues (biopsies) that are later sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). However, histology suffers from major weaknesses: First the standard HE protocol cannot work in vivo and requires ex vivo biopsies. Second HE is labour intensive, time consuming and the final tissue sections inspection is possible only after 12 hours. A faster but less accurate protocol, known as extemporaneous histology, can be performed in 40 min and is used in an intra-operative context to guide surgeries. The SpeckleCARS project aims to develop for the first time fast label free tomography microscopy with vibrational sensitivity to provide images with tridimensional improvement as compared to extemporaneous histology and in near-perfect concordance with conventional stained HE histology. This pioneering approach overcomes all the previous challenges: Using a wide field reflection scheme and label free contrast rules out all the drawbacks due to tissue removal and external labelling. It provides instantaneous intraoperative 3D histological data, improving the accessibility and accuracy of tumour detection, diagnosis and treatment. Combining the latest advances in 3D tomography reconstruction algorithms, high power laser systems together with key innovations in random speckle illumination and hyperspectral vibrational imaging, the SpeckleCARS project will provide for the first time volumetric histology imaging in real time over large (mm) fields of view without the need of tissue removal. To demonstrate the power of the developed technologies both ex vivo human and in vivo mouse cancer assessments will be conducted in collaboration with pathologists. The SpeckleCARS approach is broadly applicable to all cancer types and to any tissue diagnostic requiring histological data, so the project breakthroughs will benefit many medical and biology

festival's values peace, tolerance, human dignity and freedom of expression to continue promoting high quality European films. By bringing together festival-goers, filmmakers and industry representatives in numerous events and facilitating exchanges on art and social issues, we particularly strive to shine a light on underrepresented points of view. The festival's young and committed audience consistently engages enthusiastically in in-depth film discussions, masterclasses and round-table discussions. \\nThe film selection emphasises the artistic quality of films and the personal and creative approach of filmmakers. A total of six competitions and various out-of-competition programmes are on offer. In addition to classic film formats, interactive works exploring the new possibilities of virtual storytelling can also be discovered at DOK Leipzig.\\nWe intend to continue making use of these outlets and complement the on-site programme by recording film talks, giving filmmakers the opportunity to create short videos for use on social media, and promoting the festival extensively on digital media.\\nAlthough the conditions for cultural events in the near future are still uncertain, our planning is based on the assumption that we will again be able to welcome industry representatives, filmmakers and cinema-goers on site in 2021 and 2022. The offer in Leipzig's cinemas and venues will nevertheless be supplemented by a two-week streaming festival following the physical event. We expect around 48,000 visitors and a good 1,800 accredited guests per festival edition. \\nAs an international festival with a strong reputation, DOK Leipzig is committed to the principles of gender parity, inclusion, diversity and sustainability. While we have taken numerous steps to implement these principles in the past, we continue to work towards improvement in all of these areas.\\n\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Animation'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101052936'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['126000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":949226481,\"legalName\":\"LEIPZIGER DOK-FILMWOCHEN GMBH\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"04109\",\"street\":\"KATHARINENSTRASSE 17\",\"city\":\"Leipzig\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.3424395\",\"longitude\":\"12.374308\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"126000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['DOK Leipzig 2021-2022'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:22.951+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052936/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052936/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['126000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-09T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:22.835+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101052936'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101052936_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"DOK Leipzig is one of the leading festivals for artistic documentary and animated films in Germany as well as in Europe and with its more than 65-year history the oldest in the world. After a festival edition without any filmmakers and festival guests present on site in 2020, we were fortunately able to hold our 64th and 65th festival editions again mainly as in-person events in Leipzig. Turning the focus back to on-site events has been our response to the need for direct exchanges among visitors and industry professionals – a decision which was very well received by our audience and the accredited guests. DOK Leipzig proved to be an important event for the film industry despite the still ongoing pandemic.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"DOK Leipzig 2021\\\\n\\\\nFrom 25 to 31 October 2021, we presented 172 films and XR experiences from 55 countries, as well as numerous talks and panels. All films were screened in 11 selected Leipzig venues in compliance with hygiene regulations. A selection of 72 festival films was available online throughout Germany in the “DOK Stream” for 14 days following the festival week.\\\\nDOK Industry for the first time took place in hybrid form, with many events being held simultaneously online and in Leipzig. Around 1,400 accredited professionals took advantage of networking and education opportunities, including around 500 online participants from many countries around the world. \\\\n\\\\nDOK Leipzig 2022\\\\n\\\\nOur 65th festival edition took place from 17 to 23 October 2022 – once again mainly in local cinemas and venues. We presented 255 films and XR experiences from 55 countries as well as film talks and master classes in 11 Leipzig venues. \\\\nHowever, some of our online features continued, but in a reduced format. Those included livestreams and recorded film talks, as well as our VOD programme “DOK Stream”. This year, we focused on award-winning films and made 11 films available online throughout Germany for 7 days following the festival week.\\\\nDOK Industry also returned to a focus on in-person participation, with live streams, recordings and podcasts also providing online access to the programme for those who couldn’t attend in person. 1,471 international industry representatives met in Leipzig, with a further 210 accredited participants attending remotely. On two days after the end of the festival, accredited professionals had a further opportunity to network online. In total, DOK Industry recorded around 8,425 attendances this year.\\\\n\\\\nEuropean films presented by DOK Leipzig \\\\n\\\\nThe European film programming is an integral part of DOK Leipzig. Due to the festival\\\\u0027s long history as a meeting place for Western and Eastern European film professionals, the percentage of European and European non-national films is constantly high.\\\\nIn 2021, we showed a total of 182 films (including the Summer Cinema screenings). 90 of them have been produced in non-national EU countries and 54 in Germany. 73 non-national films were originating in a MEDIA country with a low audio-visual production capacity.\\\\nIn 2022, we presented 255 films (including Summer Cinema and fundraiser screenings, excluding films that have already been screened in 2021). 132 of those have been produced in non-national EU countries and 73 in Germany. 21 non-national films were originating in a MEDIA country with a low audio-visual production capacity.\",\"finalResults\":\"In 2021, we recorded a total of 38,950 visitors on site and online. This is about 80 per cent of the 48,000 visitors recorded before the start of the pandemic or at the hybrid edition in 2020. However, it is important to note that the festival offerings of DOK Leipzig 2020 largely took place online and were perceived virtually. In 2021, by contrast, 16,957 visitors attended the festival on-site. Against the backdrop that the events could only be implemented with reduced seating capacity and access restrictions due to COVID-19, the fact that around 80 per cent of the available seats were filled is a pleasing result of the first on-site festival edition since the beginning of the pandemic. \\\\n\\\\nSome film programmes that had to be suspended due to the pandemic in 2020, could be realized in 2021, such as the Retrospective, the Matinee Saxon State Archive, the DEFA Matinee and the series “Modular \\\\u0026 Modified – Animation and Musique Concrète”. These programmes were received very well and nearly sold out. The screenings at the Leipzig Central Station were filled to capacity (870 visitors). The festival opening as well as the two award ceremonies could again take place as festive events in the cinemas and were very well attended. Due to the hygiene measures, we were able to offer max. 780 people the opportunity to visit DOK Neuland. The exhibition was filled to capacity. Some visitors spent three to four hours with the immersive and interactive works. The online exhibition on Viveport and YouTube was also very well received: 652 streams were recorded.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, a total of 41,523 festival attendances have been registered. Particularly satisfying was the interest shown in the events on site. 30,596 attendees were counted at the cinema screenings, talks and industry events as well as at the DOK Neuland exhibition.\\\\nThe Retrospective “The Female Documentarists of the GDR” as well as the two Matinees on related themes were very well received. The two Master Classes by Mila Turajlić and Špela Čadež also met with enthusiasm. The free screenings at the Leipzig Central Station were again in high demand (more than 1,000 visitors), as was our XR exhibition (more than 900 visitors). \\\\n\\\\nOur community continues to grow on all social media channels. In December 2022, DOK Leipzig had over 31,570 subscribers on Facebook, 12,250 followers on Twitter, 10.980 on Instagram and 850 on LinkedIn.\\\\nBoth editions of DOK Leipzig received strong interest from national and international journalists. In 2021, 118 media representatives were accredited, of which 97 attended the festival on site and 21 online. In 2022, 126 journalists have been accredited, most of them also attending on site (101 persons; 25 journalists attended online). \\\\n\\\\nNational coverage continued to be wide-ranging in both years. Daily German newspapers such as Tagesspiegel, taz, Neues Deutschland, Süddeutsche Zeitung, FAZ, and Die Zeit as well as several national film media, such as Blickpunkt Film, Filmdienst, Cargo and Film \\\\u0026 TV Kamera, reported on the festival. Regional newspapers also published numerous in-depth articles. The German news agencies spread articles that were picked up across Germany. Extensive TV and radio reports have been broadcasted and published online. Print and online reports appeared in. \\\\n\\\\nInternational trade media also covered the festival broadly with several articles published by Cineuropa, Screen, Business Doc Europe and in the 2021 launched film review website The Film Verdict. In addition, articles appeared on Mubi Notebook, Documentary Magazine, ray Filmmagazin, Realscreen, DEED News, Modern Times Review, East European Film Bulletin and Dokumentarni.net.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052945', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052945/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Cinéma Defacto -

Le Slate est composé, d\\\\u0027une part, de projets d\\\\u0027auteurs confirmés: TRANSAMAZONIA c\\\\u0027est le quatrième long-métrage de Pia Marais, UN CHAMP DE FRAIS POUR L\\\\u0027ÉTERNITÉ c\\\\u0027est le 4ème long-métrage de Alain Raoust.

Pour TRANSAMAZONIA, nous avons travaillé sur plusieurs fronts au cours de la période concernée. Nous avons : finalisé la version du scénario pour le tournage, finalisé le casting de Byrne, et sommes en phase de finalisation du financement. Ce travail a permis d\\\\u0027annoncer que la mise en production de Transamazonia a été approuvé par nous et nos partenaires pour mai 2023.\\\\n\\\\nII. En ce qui concerne UN CHAMP DE FRAISES POUR L’ÉTÉRNITÉ, nous avons décidé de reporter le tournage pour l’été 2023. L\\\\u0027un des principaux risques que nous avions identifié concernant le film était le calendrier serré de la distribution principale. Or, l’un des membres principaux du casting a dû se retirer du projet en raison d’un congé parental, ce qui nous a rendu impossible le calendrier précédément établi. \\\\n\\\\nEn parallèle, certaines subventions importantes sur lesquelles nous comptions n’ont pas été obtenues. Dans ces conditions, nous avons jugé préférable de reporter le tournage à l\\\\u0027année prochaine. \\\\n\\\\nNous avons ainsi réorienté le développement du projet et avons réussi à compléter deux des objectifs indiqués ci-dessus : Alain Raoust a livré une nouvelle version du scénario, que nous avons partagée avec MEDIA via la plateforme. De plus, les voyages de repérage qui ont eu lieu cet été nous ont permis d\\\\u0027établir le cahier des charges des lieux de tournage et d\\\\u0027entamer les discussions pour réserver ces lieux pour l\\\\u0027été prochain. \\\\n\\\\nIII. PÉPITE est le projet de notre Slate 2021 dont le développement est le moins avancé. Ces derniers mois, Cyril Houplain a été accueilli par la résidence d’écriture organisée par le Groupe Ouest, en Bretagne, où il a eu l’opportunité de travailler sur l’écriture du projet dans un cadre prestigieux et aux côtés d’autres auteurs de renom. Le projet poursuit donc son cours comme annoncé.\\\\n\\\\nIV. Finalement, pour PESCA et en ce qui concerne le financement, nous n\\\\u0027avons pas encore obtenu le montant souhaité qui nous permettrait de tourner dans des conditions optimales.

However, the electrochemical potentials of reaction partners are only comparable within one solvent. This is a consequence of the solvent specific standard states.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is a Grand Challenge to establish a Unified Redox Scale to compare electrochemical potentials in all media without extra-thermodynamic assumptions. To achieve this, we use an ‘ideal’ Ionic Liquid Salt Bridge setup to measure the Gibbs transfer energies between different solvents. The measured values, corrected for residual liquid junction potential contributions, will be used to directly connect potentials to the aqueous scale. This unifying solvent-independent scale will allow for knowledge-based comparison and selection of reagents for redox reactions in the next sections.\\n\\nReagents for deelectronation (removal of an e–) at high potential are scarcely available. Hence, we prepare perhalogenated radical cation salts that act as innocent Deelectronators (iD+) with high unified redox potentials. An iD+ converts a given neutral M to the ‘naked’ cation M+. iD+-salts are straightforwardly accessible and room-temperature stable materials. Conveniently, they are in part weighable in air. Combined with suitable non-reactive, weakly coordinating but polar innocent solvents and robust weakly coordinating anions, reactive cation salts are accessible.\\n\\nSuch reversible iD+-mediated redox-processes at high potential are appealing for electrosynthesis and -catalysis. To generate, study and apply these systems, we introduce a generally applicable innocent solvent family compatible with the high potential of iD+ and M+ – also with commercially available anions.

earth elements (REE) and transition and post-transition metals (TM) are essential to modern life, yet we know little about how they concentrate at Earth’s surface, especially on the seafloor, which holds vast reserves. The DEEP-SEE project will shift paradigms on marine metal deposits from chemical composition and resource inventories to a holistic view based on atomic-scale observations and modeling. This research will determine geochemical processes that give rise to some of the highest metal partitionings in supergene ores. First, crystal chemistry of 3+ REE in biogenic vs. authigenic sedimentary apatite is proposed as a new proxy for the paleoceanographic enrichment setting with the potential to become an indicator for future exploration sites. Second, crystal chemistry of 3+ REE will elucidate the scavenging history of Fe-Mn crusts and corresponding evolution of seawater REE as recorded in growth layers over millions of years. Third, investigation of the redox chemistry and mineralogy of Fe-Mn crusts and nodules will explain how the redox-sensitive metals Co, Ce, Tl, and Pt are enriched from 109 to 106 times relative to seawater. To date, these processes have been impossible to interrogate because of analytical challenges posed by the multi-elemental composition and mineralogical heterogeneity of seafloor deposits. A promising approach for tackling these challenges is new micro-X-ray emission spectroscopy using a unique high-luminosity compact XES spectrometer at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Installation of the spectrometer on a microfocus beamline under construction on the new 4th generation ESRF X-ray source will provide a momentous gain of at least 100 in detection limit and unprecedented sensitivity and precision in the analysis of REE and TM. More broadly, the research will show how new knowledge about Earth processes can be obtained with a fresh look at individual trace elements previously inaccessible by crystal chemical study.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052913'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2370431.25'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999484121,\"legalName\":\"EUROPEAN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITY\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"38000\",\"street\":\"71 AVENUE DES MARTYRS\",\"city\":\"Grenoble\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.2076786\",\"longitude\":\"5.6922896\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"1815518.5\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":985804405,\"legalName\":\"ECOLE NORMALE SUPERIEURE DE LYON\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"69342\",\"street\":\"PARVIS RENE DESCARTES 15\",\"city\":\"Lyon\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.7332169\",\"longitude\":\"4.833241874137024\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"512500\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"thirdParty\",\"pic\":999997930,\"legalName\":\"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75794\",\"street\":\"RUE MICHEL ANGE 3\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8476256\",\"longitude\":\"2.2640027\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"42412.5\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['DEEP-SEE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

Offering a high-quality line-up of carefully selected films, Curtas Vila do Conde promotes the discovery of new films and filmmakers but also honours the heritage of Cinema. With its competition programs (International, Portuguese, Children, Experimental, Music Videos and Students) for fiction, documentary and animation and its side programmes (Special Programmes, Film-concerts, Exhibitions, educational activities and industry events), Curtas presents, every year, around 200 European films, after a process with over 5000 submissions for its competitions. Apart from competitions, the festival was held around its core sections and activities, either in its venues or online (streaming, webinars, debates): from Short To Features, premiere of new films; In Focus and New Voices, retrospective programs with films and masterclasses; Cinema revisited; Video Library; Debates, masterclasses and educational activities; Curtas Pro, the industry-related activities programme; Exhibitions. With well-balanced programming, aiming at independent and innovative short and feature films, the festival aims to provide a platform for film lovers, filmmakers, professionals and programmers. 9 days as a meeting point for a large number of film fans and more than 350 professionals – filmmakers and other artistic talents, curators and programmers, distributors, critics, academics, etc. – where MEDIA support allows to achieve the aforementioned objectives. We expect every year the presence of 150 filmmakers, producers and other talents related to films, 80 programmers and buyers, 60 critics and journalists, in a total of more than 400 professionals invited. Produced by a qualified team of more than 10 full time jobs, 20 seasonal jobs and over 100 volunteers, the Festival aims at all target audiences, from children and families to general audiences, presenting films to an overall audience of 40.000, including a large number of year-long activities. Every year we work and program the festival to increase the number of screenings, the overall audience and the promotion of European cinema with a special attention to first-time visitors and younger audiences, proposing a diversified and all inclusive program that might attract new target audiences which are not the core of film festivals. This is followed by a careful program to enlarge film education activities, especially those dedicated to young children and teenagers, based on our experienced permanent education service running all year, and to increase the participation of students with dedicated actions inside the program.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The 29th edition of Curtas, 16th and 25th of July, was challenging due to COVID pandemic. This edition has obtained an excellent response from the public, both in terms of adherence and compliance with safety recommendations, exceeding the best expectations. Besides the competition program (International Competition, National Competition, Experimental Competition, Music Videos Competition, Curtinhas and Take One Competition) the festival was highlighted by the In Focus section dedicated to Lynne Ramsay. Solar – Galeria de Arte Cinemática presented a solo exhibition by Portuguese director Diogo Costa Amarante “Be Your Selfie”, who won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 2017. Curtas Vila do Conde 2021 outcomes: 83 screenings, with 245 films in the program and 46 countries represented. 308 accredited professionals (directors, producers, actors, curators, distributors, press) participated in several industry activities. 2 film-concerts, 10 debates and presentations, 1 exhibition.

The available seats in the two venues of the Theatre, respecting the rules in force for cultural events, were reduced to 50%. The festival screened all films from the National Competition in Cinema Trindade (Porto) and Cinema Ideal (Lisbon). Curtas has made its program available on an online platform to compensate for the audience numbers due to the pandemic, but also to expand the possibility of participating in the festival, for those who could not or did not feel safe in visiting the event in Vila do Conde. Online viewing of each film was limited to 524 seats (the original number of seats in our main room), and no more than 15 days. Each film was made available the day after its screening in Vila do Conde, thus guaranteeing its premiere in Theaters. Substantial changes in 2021 with positive impacts: make the films of the festival program available online; reaching a broader audience and introducing new ways of communicate European cinema; using new technology and digital communication tools; extended the national competition sessions to other cities such as Porto and Lisbon at the same time of the festival, reaching new audiences; 9 talks with directors streaming live on Facebook.\\\\nThe 30th Curtas Vila do Conde in 2022 - 9th to 17th July 2022 -, marked by the end of covid-19 related restrictions took its original form with a few changes that impacted a broader audience, such as the online streaming of special sessions and debates. The celebration of the festival in 30 different locations was an opportunity to create a positive impact in local communities, bringing them closer to cultural activities and cinema. The very successful traveling cinema by the “Inflatable cinema” where we programmed a special selection of short films for children, families and young people living in Vila do Conde parishes surpassed our expectations in terms of outcomes, impacting 448 visitors in 8 different villages in a total of 24 sessions. Substantially changes on the festival website - responsive on all devices; adapting to online platform for festival management - Filmchief; online streaming of 11 sessions, including talks and debates during the festival; celebrating the festival in 30 different locations, bringing European cinema, audiovisual works, concerts and exhibitions traveling to uncommon places reaching new audiences - children and families.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052998', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052998/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '08D5C232D4F4E3F7ED159B61B5FBB679387C375925E7EF49900D79E80D2808D7', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:28.009+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-07-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Data Stories: Producing stories about and with property and planning data'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['08D5C232D4F4E3F7ED159B61B5FBB679387C375925E7EF49900D79E80D2808D7'], 'objective': ['Planning and property data are the key evidence base for how cities are understood, planned and developed, informing public perception, guiding investments, and shaping policy. Yet, little critical attention has been paid to planning and property data and their lifecycles, circulation, politics, power and use in policy and stakeholder decision-making. This lacuna raises two important challenges that require redress if the validity of analysis, interpretation and decision-making is to be improved. First, transforming the ontological and epistemological understanding of planning and property data amongst those that utilise them. Second, fostering a reflexive approach to data politics and power in organisations that produce, share and use planning and property data. DATASTORIES will tackle these challenges by conducting research in a creative, highly engaged way with key stakeholders across three domains (state, business, NGOs/civil society). It will develop an innovative methodological approach that blends social science and research-creation methods, working with creative writers and artists, to map an entire data ecosystem (Dublin, Ireland), unpack data assemblages and produce a variety of data stories. 12 in-depth case studies will produce 36 data stories about and with planning and property data. The project will produce four key advances: new knowledge about the evidence-base for planning and property and its use; critical insight into the politics and praxes of data; novel research-creation methods and an assessment of their efficacy; and an extended conception of data stories and an understanding of their production and utility for different audiences.

Why are some visual stimuli consciously perceived, whereas others remain subliminal? What is the relation between conscious perception, attention and working memory? Recent work of my lab demonstrated that weak but simple stimuli can be reported once they elicit a minimal level of activity in the frontal cortex, which is related to the storage of the stimulus in working memory. For these simple stimuli, the visual cortex acts as a relay station that needs to pass the information to higher cortical areas. However, we found that the perception of more complex visual stimuli relies on a more sustained interaction between visual cortex and associative brain regions, related to scene segmentation and visual attention. These recent results pave the way for a genuine understanding of mechanisms for consciousness, inspiring new paradigms that assess the awareness of stimuli while varying the demands on attention and working memory. The present proposal will be the first to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across most brain regions. We will measure the activity of single neurons in human patients who are implanted with electrodes as part of their treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We will also use a new method that permits the recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will use perturbation methods at numerous locations throughout the brain in combination with functional imaging in monkeys to measure a “functional connectome” and to investigate the brain regions in which activity does (or does not) readily lead to a reportable experience.

The field has rapidly moved towards end-to-end neural approaches which aim to directly solve the machine learning problem for raw acoustic signals but often only loosely taking into account the nature and structure of the processed data. The main consequences are that the models are 1) overly complex, require massive amounts of data to be trained and extreme computing power to be efficient (in terms of task performance), and 2) remain largely unexplainable and non-interpretable.

Also in 2021, the 67th International Short Film Festival Oberhausen went exclusively online, due to the pandemic. The 68th International Short Film Festival Oberhausen took place in May 2022 as a hybrid festival on the web and on site in Oberhausen. \\\\nOberhausen is the ideal platform to promote and find new films and talents from Europe and all over the world. About 7,500 films are expected to be submitted for every edition. In the future, in addition to the on-site event, extensive dialogical offerings are to be created year-round in the digital space to complement offerings in Oberhausen that are limited in terms of space and time. Oberhausen offers a wide range of different programmes, such as competitions, thematic programmes, children and youth programmes on-site and online. Panel discussions, industry meetings, film education workshops, events for the general public, and satellite events outside the Festival completes the programme.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The main objects for Oberhausen are: \\\\nPromotion of European (non-national) films \\\\nExpand environmental friendliness \\\\nIncreased Digital Communication \\\\nRecovery from the pandemic crisis \\\\n\\\\n2021\\\\nAt ten days, the second online edition of the Short Film Festival was twice as long as usual. In eight competitions, three of them new, the festival awarded prizes worth nearly 52,000 euros, more than ever before. The Short Film Festival reached audiences in 75 countries; almost 1,400 festival passes were sold, significantly less than in 2020 when the first online edition of a film festival was held in Germany. Over 1,000 trade visitors were accredited; moreover, more than 200 people used the THIS IS SHORT pass of the European Short Film Network to watch films at the Short Film Festival. All in all, the Short Film Festival registered around 2,600 visitors and almost 60,000 viewings of the roughly 400 films in the programme.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 seven competitions, the 68th festival showed 163 current short film productions competing for prizes worth a total of 48,250 euros. The major thematic programme, planned also for 2021, \\\\\"Synchronise! Pan-African Film Networks\\\\\" examined the special production processes on the African continent, the entrepreneurial and artistic ingenuity born of difficult conditions, which can also be groundbreaking for Western countries. In six shows of works, the Short Film Festival presents legendary filmmakers and those yet to be discovered: Morgan Fisher (USA), Sohrab Hura (India), Rainer Komers (Germany), Shalimar Preuss (France), Sylvia Schedelbauer (Germany/Japan) and Eszter Szabó (Hungary). The festival celebrated its return to cinema with a series of programmes combining cinema with live elements, including the Conditional Cinema or Celluloid Expanded series. A special country focus was dedicated to the film country Lithuania. Music videos, children\\\\u0027s films, historical films and many others were also on the festival programme.\",\"finalResults\":\"The continuing importance of the Short Film Festival as one of the most important international platforms for the short form is shown by the approximately 800 accreditations or visits from over 70 countries and the extremely positive feedback from international festival guests and audiences, who after two online editions once again had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and see short films on the big screen. Receptions such as the 20th anniversary of AG Kurzfilm or the Lithuanian Embassy certainly contributed to this. The many opportunities to meet at the festival were requested in a friendly and relieved manner.\\\\n\\\\nWithin three years, the Short Film Festival has developed considerably technologically and strategically and is on its way to becoming a film festival that is no longer limited to place and time. This opens up the possibility of reaching audiences that could never have been reached locally in Oberhausen, far beyond national borders, through a new kind of structure.\\\\n\\\\nAll international events will probably continue to attract considerably lower audiences on site for quite some time due to the pandemic and above all the climate crisis, including the Short Film Festival; in all likelihood, it will be difficult to achieve audience figures like in the past. The first local festival edition is certainly not a meaningful indicator for the future, but it confirms the not-very-optimistic forecast from the previous year. It was all the more important not to cancel the festival twice in a row, but to use the pandemic as momentum for structural change and as a sign of the festival\\\\u0027s innovative strength, and above all to keep the network and contacts active.\\\\nThere is no question that a considerable number of outstanding short films are still being made and that they also need a platform; this can already be seen in the undiminished number of competition submissions compared to 2019. However, after the pandemic, with the climate crisis and in some cases considerable economic restrictions, completely new questions arise as to how a film festival can contribute to bringing films and audiences together, or in what ways this should happen in the future.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-02-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-01-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052997', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'C9C744C7EF7FB8563BD245F761C76A321B0A0B27F2F26A91364D41C3C86B1C77', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.677+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Engineered Particles for Chemical Communication'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['C9C744C7EF7FB8563BD245F761C76A321B0A0B27F2F26A91364D41C3C86B1C77'], 'objective': ['This project aims to the development of communication at the nanoscale and to advance in the understanding of how abiotic micro/nanoparticles can communicate between them and how micro/nanoparticles can communicate with living systems. In this context, an approach for establishing communication at the nanometric level is to mimic how nature communicates. Chemical or molecular communication, based on transmitting and receiving information by means of molecules (chemical messengers) is one of the communication forms used by living organisms. Moreover, many swarm systems found in nature communicate by modifying the environment using a concept called stigmergy. The advantages of nanoparticles that communicate each to another are immediately obvious; they constitute the basis of a dynamically interacting network eventually resulting in certain autonomy of the system. If we would be able to raise the bases for communication between micro/nanoparticles and between micro/nanoparticles and cells, the potential future applications in the biomedical field, environmental research and industry technology are almost unlimited. The project will establish firm handholds for the use of nanoparticles able to communicate from one to another and with cells in different applications. The project will trace, optimise and adapt all single steps from the idea to its implementation into applicable final systems with the aim of targeting issues that are difficult to address with conventional single particles. The project is divided into three WPs. The first work package (WP1) will create the basic elements for chemical communication. In a more complex situation, WP2 will use the tools of WP1 to develop systems able to establish communication between nanoparticles and living systems. Finally, WP3 will generate nano-systems integrating gated nanoparticles and up-to-date electronics to develop new communication structures.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052997'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2499193'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999864846,\"legalName\":\"UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"46022\",\"street\":\"CAMINO DE VERA SN EDIFICIO 3A\",\"city\":\"Valencia\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"10.6535689\",\"longitude\":\"-61.1942361\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2458165\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"thirdParty\",\"pic\":997154957,\"legalName\":\"CONSORCIO CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION BIOMEDICA EN RED M.P.\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"28029\",\"street\":\"CALLE MONFORTE DE LEMOS 5\",\"city\":\"Madrid\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"40.4167047\",\"longitude\":\"-3.7035825\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"41028\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['EDISON'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.830+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052997/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2499193'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-09-09T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:27.804+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101052997'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2022-10-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43108390101052956', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101052956/HORIZON', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'E899B3FEB4F63CF1E96EEB05F690A403B81D40985160B3D67F334FD49F70069F', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['HORIZON ERC Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:24.714+0200'], 'endDate': ['2027-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Beyond hyperelasticity: a virgin land of extreme materials'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['E899B3FEB4F63CF1E96EEB05F690A403B81D40985160B3D67F334FD49F70069F'], 'objective': ['Beyond bifurcation, beyond instability, beyond even hyper-elasticity (!) there is an unexplored world of superior materials, capable of introducing a high-tech revolution and even influencing our daily lives. Surpassing bifurcation and instability yields unprecedented deformational capabilities and going beyond the concept of the elastic potential leads to materials capable of absorbing energy from the environment in a closed cycle of deformation and releasing it upon request. The road to this new paradigm is the fusion of the concepts of structural mechanics with the principles of solid mechanics, both brought to the highly nonlinear realm of extreme deformation. This opens virgin territory, left unexplored since the 100-years-old definition of the elastic potential, which has been treated until now as inviolable dogma. But structural engineers know structures capable of harvesting energy from the wind or becoming dynamically unstable when subject to follower loads, so that the implantation of these structural concepts in microscale form into a macroscopic solid leads to the creation of materials surpassing the concept of elastic potential and opening new horizons in the design of new materials. Our recent work exhibited that a purely elastic and conservative system can experience flutter instability. This strongly implies that an elastic solid can be devised that will exhibit this instability and violates hyper-elasticity. Implementing these concepts at the microscale (with elements generating microscopic interactions to suck/deliver energy from/to external sources) leads to architected materials which may harvest energy, or release it to move a mechanism, or propagate a signal with amplification, or suffer a Hopf bifurcation and self-oscillate at designed frequency.

A defining feature of these markets is that lenders give up goods today in exchange for a promise to receive goods in the future. Clearly, these promises are only valuable if they are expected to be honoured. We can think of promises as being backed by collateral, which – for the purpose of this proposal – I use as a generic term to denote the stream of future income that borrowers can credibly pledge. It is an economy’s stock of collateral that determines the amount and type of promises that can be traded, and thus the ability of financial markets to intermediate resources efficiently. \\n\\nIn past research, I have studied the key determinants and effects of an economy’s total stock of collateral. But there is a crucial aspect of the problem that deserves further study. In a world of heterogeneous agents, what matters for the allocative efficiency of financial markets is not just the overall stock of collateral, but also its distribution across firms, sectors and countries. Moreover, this distribution is largely endogenous, as it is shaped by general equilibrium forces and is bound to change when the economy does. In this proposal, I focus on three major ongoing shifts in the global economy and their effects on the distribution of collateral and the efficiency of financial markets: (i) declining interest rates; (ii) rising market power; and (iii) shifting distribution of power across countries. \\n\\n\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Macroeconomics', ' efficiency of financial markets', ' low interest rates', ' market power', ' hegemonic stability'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101052964'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['1336250'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":998154445,\"legalName\":\"Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI)\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"08005\",\"street\":\"RAMON TRIAS FARGAS  25/27\",\"city\":\"Barcelona\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"41.38973205\",\"longitude\":\"2.190045333831681\",\"activityType\":\"Research organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"1336250\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"REC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['MACROTRENDS_FINANCE'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

The potential to conquer new audiences is substantial.\\\\n\\\\nThrough four levers, our global strategy aimed to bringing back spectators to our festival theaters, to rejuvenate and diversify our audiences, to sensitize them more particularly to non-national European cinema:\\\\n\\\\n1) Mediation during the festival: the purpose of accompanying film works is, on one hand, to offer  festival audiences a more intimate knowledge of non-national European works, and on the other hand, to reach new potential audiences.  \\\\n\\\\n2) Continuation and expansion of the numerous mechanisms for raising awareness, building audience loyalty and broadening the audience as a whole (mediation with targeted audiences...). \\\\n\\\\n3) Hybrid communication policy using traditional and digital tools, during the festival and throughout the year. \\\\n\\\\n4) Development of actions on “education to images” \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, in order to contribute to a better promotion and circulation of European cinema, Fema aimed to remobilize professionals by encouraging their participation, by developing partnerships, during the festival itself and throughout the year.\\\\n\\\\nFor all these actions, the festival wished to be part of a perspective both virtuous- parity-inclusive and environmentally friendly.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In 2021 and 2022, Fema offered an eclectic program, geographically and thematically diverse, demanding and balanced, around various sections with a large majority of European films: Tributes, Retrospectives, Discoveries, a section of 45 unreleased films and previews, a section of restored films…\\\\nIn 2022, the Festival La Rochelle Cinema celebrated its 50th edition with an expanded program and the welcoming of prestigious guests.\\\\nIn 2021, Fema screened 254 films (including 215 European films) during 383 screenings (334 during the festival and 49 after and “off-site/off-festival”). 18 European films were subtitled by Fema.\\\\nIn 2022, Fema screened 262 films (including 215 European films) during 364 screenings. 12 European films were subtitled by Fema.\\\\nIn 2021 and 2022, more than 120 screenings were presented and/or followed by Q\\\\u0026A sessions or debates. \\\\nFor each edition, many film lessons, music lessons as well as editing lessons, the “Rosselini Experience” in 2021, the “Pasolini Experience” in 2022 (films presented and commented by specialists of the Italian filmmakers\\\\u0027 works) were also programmed for the festival audience.\\\\nActions were implemented to promote accessibility to all audiences: audio-description, screenings open to specific audiences (sensory-disabled, psychiatric patients...).\\\\nNumerous events have marked these editions: cine-concert creations, concerts, exhibitions, special evening events...\\\\nIn parallel to the film program, Industry Days were held during this year’s edition, in particular to facilitate meetings between European creators and broadcasters (TV, film distributors, exhibitors...) around European works. \\\\nThroughout the year, the festival has implemented a series of actions (workshops, masterclasses, off-site/off-festival screenings) aimed at developing audiences and educating pupils and students to images, youngsters, local residents, inmates, hospital patients…\\\\nNumerous industry partnerships and collaborations have been set up, encouraging promotion and circulation of the works presented at Fema: programming agreements, co-productions, artist support, accessibility…\",\"finalResults\":\"After an unusual edition in 2021, the festival returned in 2022 to levels comparable to those of the pre-COVID editions.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all ticket, multi-entry-card and pass categories significantly increased between 2021 and 2022. \\\\n\\\\nSales of reduced-rate tickets and entry-cards (especially for under-25-year-old) increased a lot between 2021 and 2022 (+95% for 5-entry reduced-rate cards...). These indicators are encouraging and show, on one hand, that the festival is winning back its audience, and on the other hand, the success of its policy in terms of cultural and educational action throughout the year (which was reinforced in 2022), as well as the impact of the festival digital strategy. \\\\nThe organization of numerous off-site/off-festival events in the following winter has allowed us to continue the festival approach of broadening and renewing its audience. \\\\nAt the end of these editions, including the figures of the festival edition itself and those of the off-site/off-festival events throughout the year, we reach a total of 54 544 admissions in 2021, and 97,761 admissions (including 88,908 for the festival only) in 2022.\\\\n\\\\nInnovative actions, carried out on an experimental basis for target groups, have made it possible to develop accessibility to non-national European films: for example in 2021 and 2022, screenings of the new Original Version with Audio Subtitles process were presented to a group of visually-impaired festival-goers.\\\\n\\\\nThe industry professional attendance increased a lot between 2021 and 2022: we had a total of 1,262 accredited professionals (compared to 862 in 2021), including 55 industry professionals from outside France (39 in 2021) despite the resurgence of the epidemic in early July, notably from more than 10 MEDIA countries. \\\\n\\\\nMeetings were specifically organized for industry professionals. They were developed in 2022, allowing the reinforcement of mobilization. 20 organizations were involved in 12 meetings in 2022 (12 organizations in 6 meetings in 2021).\\\\nThe festival special sense of welcome and these industry-dedicated meetings have a real impact on promotion and subsequent circulation of films. A recent study confirms that 97% of exhibitors come to Fema to select films. And 55% of them are particularly interested in European films.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the festival period, the numerous programming agreements (with festivals, cinemathèques, distributors...) offer increased visibility to European films and encourage their subsequent circulation: purchase of rights (by TV channels as Arte, Ciné+), repeats, mutualization of costs (prints, subtitling, co-production of cine-concerts, common educational or marketing tools), editorialization, Blue-ray bonuses... \\\\n\\\\nAll-year-round activities on education to images, linked to the festival programming, which is mostly European, have made it possible to broaden the audience and had a very positive impact on the numerous participants, providing them with theoretical and practical knowledge and cultivating their spirit of curiosity. In 2021 and 2022, more than 5 000 festival-goers and more than 50 institutions and structures were concerned by these mediation actions, of which more than 600 youngsters were directly involved in the writing and directing workshops.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-04-19\",\"periodTo\":\"2023-04-18\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101052965', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101052965/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'F9D695B7E67CD7BA4165371EEA0872D135E6B99DABED41305EB30353BBEE3BF6', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:25.593+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-03-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['FIDLab - International Coproduction Platform'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101052965_10_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Accompagnement des projets en amont\",\"description\":\"Vidéos de présentation sur Festival Scope Pro\",\"code\":\"Demonstrator, pilot, prototype\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Activité: FIDLab 13e édition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-29\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4c9e4d/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_12_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"FIDLab à Cannes\",\"description\":\"Mailing FIDLab à Cannes\\\\nAgenda rendez-vous à Cannes\\\\nPhotos et vidéos\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Activité: FIDLab 13e édition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3e6ed4/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_14_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Promotion films finalisés\",\"description\":\"Newsletter\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3e8dbe/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_15_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Rapport d\\\\u0027activité de l\\\\u0027édition 2021\",\"description\":\"Rapport d’activité\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4cdf78/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_16_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Rapport mutualisation des dépenses\",\"description\":\"Rapport\\\\nmutualisation des\\\\ndépenses\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea4bed4d/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_18_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Événement de dissémination\",\"description\":\"Dissémination\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Follow up and dissemination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-03-29\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ea3f36a5/Attachment_0.zip\"},{\"id\":\"101052965_5_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Communication et marketing\",\"description\":\"Newsletters;

Cette richesse offre aux projets sélectionnés une plus grande visibilité ainsi qu’un plus grand nombre d’opportunités de collaborations, de contacts et de soutiens. \\\\n\\\\nLes porteurs de projets et les professionnels apprécient le soin apporté à l\\\\u0027accueil des projets : 1. coaching individuel pour préparer la vidéo de présentation, 2. échanges afin d’établir les besoins des projets pour cibler les one-to-one. 3. matchmaking soigné afin de diriger les professionnels vers les projets de leur intérêt. Chacun se sent porté et enveloppé dans un écrin (cf article screendaily). \\\\n\\\\nMême si les rencontres virtuelles ne peuvent pas remplacer l\\\\u0027efficacité des rendez-vous présentiels à Marseille, l’édition en ligne est source de potentiels. En ce sens, l’équipe du FIDLab continuera à se nourrir des nouvelles compétences acquises et sera en mesure de proposer des innovations sur la forme de la prochaine édition, en 2022.\\\\n\\\\nLors de la tenue de l’édition 2021, 86 projets étaient finalisés sur les 143 sélectionnés depuis le lancement du FIDLab, en 2009 soit 60% des projets. D’ici la prochaine édition du FIDLab, 10 nouveaux films existeront ce qui portera à 70% le taux de projets devenu films.\\\\n\\\\nMême s’il est encore tôt pour les projets sélectionnées en 2021, un des projets à été finalisé et sélectionné en première mondiale à la Quinzaine des réalisateurs à Cannes : Une nuit sans savoir de Payal Kapadia. Le film a obtenu l’Oeil d’Or, prix du meilleur documentaire à Cannes et il a été projeté dans plus de 20 festivals dans le monde entier et le FIDLab a accompagné sa sortie en salles en France en avril 2022. Également sélectionné à Cannes 2021, le film Ghost Song de Nicolas Peduzzi a fait sa première à l’ouverture de l’ACID et le FIDLab a accompagné sa sortie en salles en avril 2022.\\\\n\\\\nEn 2021, 24 projets sélectionnés sur 28 étaient des projets européens avec notamment 16 projets de pays européens à plus faible capacité de production. Nous cherchons également à mettre en réseau des porteurs de projets extra-européens avec des coproducteurs européens. La participation de 4 sociétés de production dans le cadre du Focus Belgique, organisé en étroite collaboration avec 4 institutions clés dans la promotion du cinéma Belge, s’inscrit dans cet esprit. En devenant un espace de rencontres et de travail entre professionnels européens qui souhaitent se mettre au service de la découverte de talents et d’œuvres, le FIDLab démontre son ambition européenne. \\\\n\\\\nEn outre, la renommée internationale du FIDMarseille et du FIDLab, reconnus comme labels, permet de faire circuler et de rendre visible des projets européens à l\\\\u0027international. La communication ciblée du FIDLab, adressée à une liste de plus de 10.000 contacts professionnels internationaux, parmi lesquels des programmateurs de festivals majeurs, les vendeurs internationaux et les distributeurs, favorise la possibilité de circulation des projets présentés à l\\\\u0027échelle mondiale.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-04-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-03-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251589101053013', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251589/101053013/CERV', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'F1645CA253D0D2DE80E76B1E8F39DA606BCFEF16A18439D402E279A109FFBC1B', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CERV Operating Grants Framework Partnerships'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T12:22:30.821+0200'], 'endDate': ['2025-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Alzheimer Europe (2022-2025)'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['F1645CA253D0D2DE80E76B1E8F39DA606BCFEF16A18439D402E279A109FFBC1B'], 'objective': ['Dementia is the leading cause of disability and dependency in older adults.

Promote and defend the rights of people with dementia as full EU citizens and give them a voice in EU and national policies by involving the European Working Group of People with Dementia in all FPA activities\\n2. Promote the compliance of national dementia policies and strategies with UNCRPD and ESRPD principles by mapping and analysing national policies, identifying good practices and promoting dementia-inclusive policies and initiatives\\n3.  Improve the capacity of its national member organisations to contribute to national and EU disability policies by organising capacity building webinars and workshops\\n4. Ensure that dementia is recognised as a leading cause of disability and dependency by actively contributing to EU policy making and supporting the implementation of the ESRPD and Social Semester process\\n5.

PEOPLE  \\\\nIn year two, three types of new services were developed for the network members to support resilience, through the TEH Hub model development, with significant uptake by the end of 2023 and new projects emerging across many countries. 2 new hubs officially launched in 2023 - The Mediterranean Hub and Youth Hub. \\\\nThe outcomes of the wellbeing hours program provided TEH members with insight into the challenges cultural workers face, as well as methods for overcoming them. \\\\nLearning resources focused on diversity issues and tools usage, with upcoming courses planned for 2024 based on identified struggles from the centers, particularly anti-eviction efforts.\\\\nFive types of new services offered to the network members centres in the areas of well-being, financial structure, capacity building, resources exchange. \\\\nOur TEH Conference in Leipzig hosting over 270 participants, had a substantial impact on both the local and international levels. It featured an innovative, curated program which inspired other potential conference hosts within the network. \\\\nAt our annual camp meeting, 200 cultural professionals travelled to Tbilisi, Georgia, coming together to learn new skills in the field of collaborative work methods and co-ownership models. \\\\nFindings from program evaluation under this objective suggest members need support from both perspectives of operating a venue and the challenges presented through operating in the wider social, political and cultural landscape. \\\\n2. BUILDINGS  \\\\nSustainability remains a key focus for members, encompassing the physical structures of buildings, environmental impact, and the broader influence of organizations as placemakers in rural and urban contexts. The network\\\\u0027s strength lies in sharing knowledge, addressing risks, and finding solutions to issues like regeneration and gentrification highlighted by members. TEH activities support cultural sector leadership and act as a cultural and creative placemaker. Members actively seek cross-contextual knowledge through staff exchanges and camp meetings.\\\\nThe Sustainable Buildings Hub (SuBHub) has grown to 50 members across 16 countries, focusing on Peer-to-Peer knowledge exchange, identifying competencies, and planning a 2024 training program for technical aspects of sustainable building transitions. Year 3 will track further development. Our Sustainability Hub enhances members\\\\u0027 understanding of Green Deal goals, fostering sustainability and inspiring other. Through the membership program, staff exchange, learning resources, and biannual meetings, we contribute knowledge, capacity, and expertise to sustainable regeneration in both urban and rural areas. \\\\n\\\\n3. ART\\\\u0026CULTURE\\\\nThe Year one report highlighted a need to understand existing ways that members have collaborated to increase the understanding of the value of their work in their communities. This is an ongoing need, especially as members highlight the need to influence local decision making and advocacy with resources that can aid this conversation. As venues act as community builders, the value of this role arguably needs to be framed and communicated in a way that can influence local politics and social sustainability. Members face challenges to influence local politics given the day to day needs of running a cultural venue, with often a small team. This need potentially highlights a greater role for TEH to further develop support resources that aid advocacy of the role of independent cultural organisations at a local level. \\\\nThroughout 2023, the management team and board of Trans Europe Halles have visited cultural centres, third-party events, and high-level political gatherings to advocate for their members and the independent cultural sector at large within the frames of the city visits and advocacy visits activities. On a micro-level for example centres under threat of eviction have been supported and on a macro-level, TEH has engaged with the work of Cultural Action Europe, On the Move, Pearle, EIT, New European Bauhaus and other European advocacy organisations.

We expect more than 150 guests from France, Germany, Spain and Romania.\\n\\nWith respect for the twinning traditions, we approach Eurozoersel 22 with fresh eyes. We welcome old friends, but also new young participants. With these young people (aged 18 to 26 years) we start a first project in April-May 2022, a prequel for the town twinning event in August: we bring together a young delegation from our twinning towns, proportionate composed of boys and girls. We instruct this group of young people  to visualize their towns: together they have to make a short film that introduces us to their world, through their young eyes. By working together on this project, European young people get the opportunity to understand each other's world. We give four themes that they should visualize in their film. These are important topics for all our European partners, and will also be the four themes of the event in August:\\n1: Europe, democracy and citizen participation\\n2: climate and local sustainable economy\\n3: (youth) culture and cultural heritage\\n4 : well-being and inclusion\\nThe youth film will be used as a common thread during the event in August. The four themes are also reflected in joint activities, visits, workshops and final debate during the Eurozoersel event.\\n\\nAs the objective of Eurozoersel 22, we want to (1) have a rejuvenated and even stronger European partnership and (2) have established at least 4 (per theme at least 1) new concrete cooperation actions for the coming years with our European twinning towns.\\n\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['climate and local sustainable economie', ' (youth) culture and cultural heritage', ' well-being and social inclusion'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251589101053000'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CERV-2021-CITIZENS-TOWN-TT'], 'overallBudget': ['23255'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":909471419,\"legalName\":\"GEMEENTE ZOERSEL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"2980\",\"street\":\"HANDELSLEI 167\",\"city\":\"Zoersel\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"BE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Belgium\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.2707158\",\"longitude\":\"4.642835\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"23255\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":948359592,\"legalName\":\"Stadt Graefenhainichen\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"06773\",\"street\":\"Markt 1\",\"city\":\"Graefenhainichen\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.7322073\",\"longitude\":\"12.4592318\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":947899715,\"legalName\":\"Stadt Laubach\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"35321\",\"street\":\"Friedrichstrasse 11\",\"city\":\"Laubach\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.54082885\",\"longitude\":\"8.990854504162188\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":3,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":942840583,\"legalName\":\"AYUNTAMIENTO DE LORA DEL RIO\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"41440\",\"street\":\"PLAZA DE ESPANA\",\"city\":\"Lora Del Río\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"37.7034094\",\"longitude\":\"-5.497948870547946\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":4,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PUB\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":938824201,\"legalName\":\"Comité de Jumelage d\\\\u0027Elancourt\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"78990\",\"street\":\"Square de la Canche 1\",\"city\":\"Elancourt\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.764641\",\"longitude\":\"1.956343\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":5,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"associatedPartner\",\"pic\":938820224,\"legalName\":\"Asociatia de Prietenie Crucea-Zoersel\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"727150\",\"street\":\"Str Principala, Crucea\",\"city\":\"Crucea-Suceava\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"RO\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Romania\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"47.3506059\",\"longitude\":\"25.6112767\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"0\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":6,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['EuroZoersel22'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

They include powerful tools from p-adic analysis,  isometries of CAT(0) cube complexes, pluripotential theory, and algebraic geometry. Simultaneously, recent arithmetic equidistribution theorems have been combined with holomorphic dynamics to solve problems of unlikely intersection in the dynamics of polynomial maps and to study parameter spaces of such maps.

IFFR celebrated its 50th edition in 2021 as an expanded hybrid multi-part festival from 1 to 7 February and from 2 to 6 June, with both festival parts connected by a dynamic series of physical and online events. The 51st edition will take place from 26 January to 6 February 2022, with an estimated 271,000 visits (COVID-19 regulations permitting) and over 2,000 industry professionals in attendance. The strategic objectives for the next 3 to 5 years, which will be detailed via organisation-wide workshops, are as follows. First, IFFR aspires to present broad and diverse cinema through a clear vision and a cohesive programme that is globally recognised as visionary, with a clear commitment to creating opportunities for filmmaking talent through numerous industry initiatives including co-production market CineMart and its Hubert Bals Fund. The audience reach will continue to be international, national and local; public, industry and education audiences shall be engaged, growing and diversifying. IFFR will make a positive difference to the cultural and social life of Rotterdam and beyond, with a global, national, and local impact on the film industry. IFFR also intends to consistently grow and deepen its partnerships and their contributions; with exemplary long-term relationships with the government, sponsors, partners and donors. Production-wise, through streamlined audience and filmmaker services, IFFR will offer optimal conditions to experience film on-site and online. Lastly, IFFR will be a sustainable, diverse and inclusive organisation with clear structures, robust planning, open communications and diversified revenue streams.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['festival', ' film festival', ' feature films', ' short films', ' audovisual work', ' virtual reality'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053058'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['150000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":946696430,\"legalName\":\"STICHTING INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ROTTERDAM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"3012 EJ\",\"street\":\"KRUISKADEHOF 36 B\",\"city\":\"Rotterdam\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.9218351\",\"longitude\":\"4.4746365\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"150000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['IFFR 2022-23'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:59.187+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053058/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053058/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['150000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-01-27T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:59.057+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053058'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-09-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053058_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"IFFR is a leading cultural platform accessible to all, that champions compelling cinema and audiovisual art. Through screenings, talks, exhibitions, and various networking opportunities, IFFR enables discovery, dialogue, learning and people coming together. We look where others don’t look, and through IFFR’s distinct programming, we open a space for ideas that captivate, engage and entertain, pushing creative boundaries that have the power to transform. IFFR supports independent storytellers and advances the impact of their work in the world.\\\\n\\\\nFFR creates opportunities for the independent filmmaking community from across the globe, to reach broad and diverse audiences. Through its visionary programming, year-round activities and forward-looking initiatives, it is a haven for the plurality of voices, audiovisual formats and storytelling, and an essential destination for film professionals and film lovers. IFFR seeks to challenge people’s views of the world and each other through film.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"For 2022, IFFR developed a programme, that due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, could not be brought to the audiences in the way it was intended. Due to a suddenly announced government enforced lockdown all cinemas were closed which forced IFFR to a last-minute switch online with a limited programme for 26 January - 6 February in 2022. This meant that none of the films (with the exception of one) could be shown on the big screen in the presence of filmmakers and audiences - which is very much the raison d\\\\u0027être of festivals including that of IFFR. However, with the online platform we’ve developed with three other Dutch film festivals, IFFR managed to pull this switch off in a short timespan and in compliance with the quality and safety standards we set out. We still reached a considerable amount of 117.267 visits during the online 2022 festival. \\\\n\\\\nThe opening film of IFFR 2022 was Amanda Kramer’s Please Baby Please. The closing film Dragon Inn by King Hu marked the opening of the 25 Encounters anniversary programme. On February 6 during the awards ceremony, Paz Encina won the Tiger Award for her feature EAMI. The special jury awards were awarded to Excess Will Save Us by Morgane Dziurla-Petit and To Love Again by Gao Linyang. \\\\n\\\\nThe results of an extensive audience experiences research show that even with IFFR taking place almost entirely online for the second year in a row, the audience still highly values the festival experience. They graded 2022’s festival experience with a 7.6 (2021: 7.7). Our audience was composed out of 20 different ethnicities, but the vast majority of the visitors held Dutch nationality. This is of course also indicative that there is still room for improvement. An interesting development is that IFFR has reached a larger audience outside the South Holland (Rotterdam) region with its online offering, with no less than 60% of the online audience coming from outside of the region.\\\\n\\\\nWe were able to present a strong selection not only to the audience, but also to Press \\\\u0026 Industry. The online Pro Daysstill provided networking opportunities and an attractive programming.CineMart returned, albeit online, with 656 one-on-one meetings. \\\\n\\\\nFollowing two online editions, IFFR 2023 was our first full in-person festival since the start of the pandemic. The film programme for audiences of our 52nd edition consisted of 455 films. Additionally, the Art Directions programme consisted of 6 art installations (including Steve McQueen’s Sunshine State, which was commissioned by IFFR), 7 performances, and 5 immersive media projects. The IFFR Talks programme also took place in-person again, with 15 talks and panels scheduled during the festival, most of which were made freely available online for audiences worldwide after the festival. A total of 91 countries were represented in the IFFR 2023 programme (a substantial growth compared to 2021 [66] and 2022 [61]). The Tiger Competition and Bright Future programme (both aimed at new talent), as well as the Short \\\\u0026 Mid-length programme, reached an almost 50/50 gender balance.\\\\n\\\\nThe openingfilm of IFFR 2023 was Munch by Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken and the closing film was All India Rank by Varun Grover. IFFR’s trademark Tiger Competition celebrates the innovative and adventurous spirit of up-and-coming filmmakers from all over the world. From 14 selected titles in 2023, Le spectre de Boko Haram by Cyrielle Raingou received the Tiger Award during the award ceremony on 2 February 2022. Munnel by Visakesa Chandrasekaram and New Strains by Artemis Shaw and Prashanth Kamalakanthan both won Special Jury Awards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIFFR looks back at its 52nd edition in 2023 with great satisfaction; the festival registered 283,506 visits – 8,871 of these visits were registered via the in 2020 created online streaming platform (in collaboration with IDFA, Cinekid and NFF), through which 25 films from our IFFR 2023 programme were made available to Dutch audiences. We have not yet reached our pre-pandemic visitor number of 340,000, but can conclude a good recovery compared to 2022 (180,637) and 2021 (271,105, two events in February and June).\\\\n\\\\nAudiences were equally satisfied with IFFR 2023. They rated the festival at a 7.9, which is higher than 2022 (7.6) and 2021 (7.7).\\\\n\\\\nIFFR Pro 2023 consisted of the following core activities: the co-production market CineMart, with the new addition of the IFFR Pro Darkroom, the talent development programmes Rotterdam Lab, BoostNL, Creative Producer Indaba, the think tank Reality Check and the Pro Hub. In essence, this means the support of filmmakers and creating visibility around their films, offering a platform for industry professionals to facilitate their network, one-to-one meetings, workshops and masterclasses, debate and conversation (IFFR Pro Dialogues). 2.510 insutry guests, 345 film makers and 680 Cinemart guests joint IFFR Pro in 2023.\",\"finalResults\":\"Thanks to Creative Media Europe, IFFR was capable of bringing a strong programme to audiences - either online or in person.

Every year it attracts more than 80,000 visitors and professionals from all over the world with the best and highest quality animations and interactive works to Stuttgart.\\nITFS is an Oscar-qualifying festival that offers directors, production and distribution companies, talents, and all other industry representatives from the fields of animation and games a platform to showcase their films, interactive and transmedia works as well as VR and AR projects to an interested broad audience and numerous representatives of the industry. At the heart of the festival are the competitions and film programmes at Innenstadtkinos. Every year up to 70,000 EUR in prize money are awarded by international juries of experts in twelve competition categories. The FMX - Conference on Animation, Effects, Games and Immersive Media and Animation Production Days (APD), the most important German co-production and financing market for animation, take place at the same time. Thanks to the special combination of film festival, trade congress and financing market, the events have developed into a unique\\nplatform for the financing and development of animation projects and attract up to 6,000 professional visitors to Stuttgart every year. ITFS 2020 and 2021 had to take place as online-only editions, reaching additional, new audiences in the process. But a festival like the ITFS is brought to live by personal, face-to face encounters. We are therefore planning a hybrid version for 2022 that combines cinema screenings and games exhibitions with digital applications and experiences in virtual space. The ITFS Festival editions are supplemented by various year long activities such as ITFS Animation Tour and ITFS Animation Special.\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053038'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['150000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":939039056,\"legalName\":\"FILM- UND MEDIENFESTIVAL GGMBH\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"70173\",\"street\":\"STEPHANSTRASSE 33\",\"city\":\"Stuttgart\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.7803263\",\"longitude\":\"9.1787405\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"150000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['ITFS'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.251+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053038/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053038/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['150000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-12T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.133+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053038'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053038_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"The Stuttgart International Festival of Animated Film (ITFS) is an Oscar-qualifying film festival with up to 100,000 visitors and among the largest and most important festivals for animated film in the world. Using the keyword Expanded Animation, ITFS pays special attention to the constant expansion of connections to other sectors of the cultural and creative industries such as games, VR, architecture, art, opera and theatre. Since ITFS was founded in 1982, the promotion of young filmmakers has been one of the festival\\\\u0027s main objectives and core competencies, especially with the Young Animation competition, university presentations and, increasingly, qualified training programmes. Over the past 15 years, the festival\\\\u0027s relevance to the industry has also been significantly expanded, for example by founding the Animation Production Days and organising the Trickstar Professional Awards. Alongside the specialised offerings for talents and professionals, ITFS primarily stands for low-threshold access for a broad regional audience, achieved with various programmes such as \\\\\"Tricks for Kids\\\\\" or \\\\\"Best of Animation\\\\\", feature film specials and the Open Air on Schlossplatz Stuttgart. Programmes such as the Country Focus, \\\\\"Animation Around Europe\\\\\" or \\\\\"In Persona\\\\\" underline the festival\\\\u0027s international relevance. The thematic series are important from a curatorial and conceptual point of view, contributing to the festival\\\\u0027s high reputation with the industry and the press. The 2021 and 2022 festival editions faced particular challenges due to the coronavirus crisis. The war in Ukraine since February 2022 has further complicated the situation for ITFS, in terms of finances and organisation as well as content. The objective and main concern was to provide an attractive and high-quality offering, for the online-only edition in 2021 as well as for the hybrid 2022 edition, geared towards the standards of previous festivals. In 2022, after two online editions, the aim was also to bring audiences and the industry back to Stuttgart and at the same time to use the digitalisation know-how developed since 2020 in the field of streaming and media libraries to develop a hybrid festival with an even stronger international impact, reaching new target groups and also audiences and professionals unable to attend due to existing lockdowns, health impairments or financial reasons.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"Due to the lockdowns resulting from the coronavirus crisis, ITFS had to be almost fully reinvented in 2020 and 2021 and new digital offerings had to be developed. The experience with and from the Online Animation Library (since 2011) provided some expertise, but this had to be significantly expanded in 2020 and especially in 2021 and 2022 in view of entirely new needs and circumstances. While the transformation of ITFS 2020 into an online event had to be done at very short notice, the 2021 edition saw a digital professionalisation, resulting in the implementation of a broad, exciting and sophisticated online programme offer consisting of a media library, webinars with live Q\\\\u0026As, digital meeting rooms and networking opportunities, which was able to address the target groups of general public, talents and professionals comprehensively with different formats. The ITFS 2021 website was accessed 250,000 times from 3-16 May. Although ITFS 2021, initially planned as a hybrid event, again had to be realised online only due to the coronavirus situation, some filmmakers and producers were on site for the opening and the awards ceremonies, which were streamed in high quality; they were also available for live interviews and talks in the festival studio. To manage the digital offerings, a digital team was set up in 2021 and 2022, consisting of existing team members and new staff. This meant that there were no redundancies during the coronavirus period either. For ITFS 2022, which could take place on site, the big challenge was to largely maintain the digital offerings while holding the on-site festival in the usual size and as far as possible with the same scope of content as in 2019, which came close to staging two festivals in parallel. The adjustment of the space capacities (25% capacity), which was initially made due to regulations, could be cancelled for the festival. Decentralisation of the venues was maintained. The greatest achievement of the 2021 and 2022 festival editions was the continued commitment of the industry and the general public to the ITFS through attractive and adapted offerings and communication measures, while introducing them to new formats. These new offerings, such as the Online+ media libraries and the specially developed OnlinePro platform, were used intensively (2021: 46,000 views of animated short and long films). The accomplishment of 2022 was the extremely complex hybrid implementation of the festival.\",\"finalResults\":\"Despite great financial (many sponsors were very cautious because of the COVID-19 situation and the war in Ukraine) and organisational challenges, the 2021 and 2022 festivals were carried out successfully and many innovations were initiated. The ITFS was certainly one of the pioneer festivals in terms of digitalisation. In 2021, an international team of designers from France, Switzerland and the Netherlands developed the ITFS VR Hub, which invited audiences to meet other festival guests virtually as avatars. Real venues were imaginatively recreated, and individual digital festival zones set up. For 2022, ITFS received additional funding for the VR Hub from the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) so that this highly innovative area of multi-user experience could be expanded and managed by specialist staff. Workshops, film screenings and meetings took place in the VR Hub, just like at the on-site festival, and were mainly used by members of the public who could not attend in person. Professionals were offered specialised webinars by ITFS in 2021 and 2022. The media library was significantly developed from 2020 to 2022 and since 2022 has been implemented with service provider Pantaflix, allowing for even higher protection and better evaluation and usage options. While ITFS took place online only in 2021 and reached over 6,800 registered users (professionals and festival pass holders) and generated a total of 250,000 page views with the free stream and free offerings, in 2022 the audience turnout shifted towards the on-site festival, as intended.\\\\nResults 2022: Online media library 19,000 views, cinemas 20,000 viewers, Open Air 25,000 viewers. The online offerings reached many guests from abroad, including China which continued to be affected by lockdowns and travel restrictions. With the return of accredited guests to ITFS 2022, much exchange and discussion could be generated on site – especially in conjunction with APD and FMX. The 2021 and 2022 tour programmes realised after ITFS continued to contribute to a very good dissemination of the ITFS programme. The professional live streams of 2021 and 2022 were an important addition to the ITFS programme and conveyed a vivid image of the international and European animation scene by way of moderation and many interviews, strengthening the reputation of ITFS among the audience and the industry.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053041', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053041/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '9F1E1A0D2CCC0ED9103A9C226713312EB328E96EC13263542FA3D00ABB19A0F1', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:06:57.449+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['M-Films audiovisual works slate development 2021-2023'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['9F1E1A0D2CCC0ED9103A9C226713312EB328E96EC13263542FA3D00ABB19A0F1'], 'objective': ['The current slate of m-films has the objective to develop three projects, which include: \\n●\\tFiction feature films SLOW (in co-production with Netherlands and Greece); FAKE NEWS (in co-production with Italy and Latvia); and VISITOR (in co-production with Spain).\\n●\\tAnimation TV series BFF (in co-production with Poland). \\n●\\tFiction short film WAITING.\\nThrough the project in our slate, we expect several professionals to be benefited: \\n●\\tThe writers, directors and creators of the projects (2 male and 3 female).\\n●\\tOur all-female company team, which consists currently of 3 members, with the ambition to grow with the addition of one more producer. \\n●\\tA great number of production personnel and creatives, including script advisors, location managers, casting directors, cinematographers, art directors and marketing consultants, who will be engaged throughout the development process. \\nThe expected result is the successful development of above-mentioned projects up to the stage of production, delivery and distribution in collaboration with our international partners. \\n\\nAs we proceed with the development of the slate, we expect several outputs, which will include final scripts, final budgets and production schedules, updated creative team, updated financing plans and the confirmation of national, international and supranational funds and financiers.

I will also quantify the impact of theses processes on the climate and on the potential for prebiotic chemistry on these planets. I propose to consider the role of organic aerosols as prebio-signature: those are nanoparticles chemically produced in the atmosphere. I will address the capacity of exo-Earths atmospheres to produce organic aerosols in various oxidative conditions, and their further physical and chemical interactions with atmospheric water. \\n\\nTo tackle these questions, I will combine experiments and models to discover the reactivity that occurs in atmospheres within an extensive range of oxidation conditions. I will experimentally determine the physical properties of the aerosols, and then model their radiative impact and their propensity to generate clouds in the atmosphere. \\nI will also experimentally identify the prebiotic molecules composing the aerosols that dissolve into clouds. This transfer from the dry organic reservoir towards liquid water is indeed critical for the emergence of life.\\n\\nThe ERC-AdG Oxyplanets project will contribute to interpret and suggest observations for the future NASA-JWST and ESA-ARIEL space missions.

The festival has been held in largest Lithuanian cities (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai) and expanded to two more cities (Alytus and Panevezys) in 2022. Both years the festival took place synchronically in all of the cities, allowing to ensure the festival guests had the opportunity to visit and meet the audiences not only in the capital;\\\\n2. The scope of the festival programme has returned to the pre-pandemic levels, screening 80 feature films and 42 shorts in 2021 and 92 feature films and 26 shorts in 2022;\\\\n3. Both years significant efforts have been dedicated to bringing the audiences back to film theatres. In 2021 to ensure that the event has been held in a hybrid format, offering a part of the presented titles, online after the main physical even has finished. In 2022 the festival has taken place in a physical-only format with a strong focus on unique live screenings (e.g. a cine-concert of a Lithuanian feature film Burial by Emilija Skarnulyte with live music by Finnish composer Timo Kaukolampi in a unique cultural space “gallery 1986”), QnA with directors and other events;\\\\n4. The physical-only approach has proven to be the most effective in terms of post-pandemic audience growth. If in 2021 the overall admissions of the festival were 17300, in 2022 the audience grew by more than 20% and reached 21300. Though still not back to pre-pandemic numbers, this indicated a healthy enough rise.\\\\n5. Schoolchildren, students and seniors could attend designated screenings at a discount rate;\\\\n6. The number of applications for the international short film competition New Baltic Cinema doubled in 2021, presenting favourable conditions for the extension of the geography of the competition to whole Europe in 2022, while still maintaining a healthy growth in applications. The updated competition with a new name Glimpses of Europe took place at the anniversary edition of the festival in 2022.\\\\n7. In addition to the growth of the short film competition, in 2022 the festival launched the feature film competition, dedicated to films by European filmmakers with a unique aesthetic and style, and is aimed at discovering bold and original works and introducing them to new audiences. The goals of the competition correspond to those pursued by the festival as a part of the European film festivals network MIOB, these goals are:\\\\nto contribute to the distribution of original non-commercial European cinema;\\\\nto promote networking between European filmmakers;\\\\nto promote the spread of European values.\\\\n8. In 2021 / 2022 the festival stayed true to its mission of presenting national works in the context of European cinema and hosted a total number of 9 premieres of Lithuanian feature films;\\\\n9. A total of 20 masterclasses and discussions have been held as a part of annual industry events „SCA Directions“ (workshops for actors and scriptwriters, in-depth presentations of films, discussions on gendered violence, etc);\\\\n10. As part of yearly initiatives not limited to the main event in 2021 / 2022 the organisers of EFF Scanorama have conducted two satellite initiatives: the early film festival Pirmoji Banga, presenting pre-WWII cinema to general audiences and Scanorama Summer, bringing quality European cinema to remote parts of Lithuania. In addition, organisers have purchased and released a total of 17 high-profile European films in Lithuanian theatres, TV and VOD platforms, making a part of them available for various film literacy programmes;\\\\n11. As part of the activities of the MIOB network, the Green Charter for Film Festivals, an environmental initiative, was launched at the Cannes Film Festival. The network invites all film festivals to sign the charter and start implementing environmentally friendly practices. The draft charter was also presented to Lithuanian film festivals during the 2022 series of industry events, after which the representatives of local festivals have proceeded to sign the Charter.\",\"finalResults\":\"The results and achievements of 2021-2022 have contributed to:\\\\n1.

In the last century, the optimization of FET technology led to the discovery of a new state of matter, in which quantum mechanics fully confines any electron motion to parallel to the interfaces, i.e.  the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\\nMagnons, the elementary excitations of the ground state magnetic order (either ferro, ferri, or antiferromagnetic) also carry spin. In high-quality magnetic materials magnons enable long-distance electronic spin information transfer. Magnonics has been studied extensively in magnetic bulk materials, or in thin films where still several sub-bands are thermally populated. The challenging major next step is to realize and study magnon and electronic spin transport in the ultimate 2D magnetic regime.\\nThe aim of this ERC Advanced project is to combine and study strictly 2 dimensional spin transport in two types of vdW magnets: in a 2D magnon gas (2DMG) in electrically insulating Van der Waals ferro and antiferromagnets and in a 2D spin gas (2DSG) in proximity-induced magnetic graphene.\\nTo achieve this aim, I will (i) fabricate high quality 2D vdW materials, heterostructures and devices; (ii) realize and study spin transport in a two-dimensional magnon gas (2DMG); (iii) realize and study a two-dimensional spin gas (2DSG) in magnetic graphene; and (vi) develop new spintronics functionalities in hybrid 2DMG and 2DSG heterostructures.\\nThis project will open a regime that has not been explored before. Magnon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon (electronic) spin interactions in 2D will lead to phenomena that are either difficult to realize in 3D, such as hydrodynamic spin current flow and self-oscillations, or have not yet been anticipated at all. 2DMG and 2DSG controlled by gates and, possibly, operating at room temperature will enrich the vdW spintronics and provide new strategies for information technology including heat management. \\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Van der Waals materials', ' magnons'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053054'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2495000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999989782,\"legalName\":\"RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"9712CP\",\"street\":\"Broerstraat  5\",\"city\":\"Groningen\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"53.2193613\",\"longitude\":\"6.5621466\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2495000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['2DMAGSPIN'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

AGORA’s industry activities for development, co-production and promotion are focusing primarily on the following countries: Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Bosnia \\\\u0026 Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Egypt, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kosovo*, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, N. Macedonia, Palestine, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine, the majority of which are A/V LCC. Countries not on this list are still welcome to apply if they value Agora as a good springboard for their project. All projects are evaluated. \\\\n\\\\nDuring the years, AGORA evolved according to the industry’s needs: \\\\n \\\\n• Agora Talks presenting new trends and practical information from Europe’s leading experts, \\\\n• Thessaloniki Locarno Industry Academy for junior professionals in the diffusion sector, \\\\n• Meet the Future presenting local film professionals to the European and international film industry, \\\\n• Agora Short Film Lab in collaboration with the international short film festivals Drama ISFF and Clermont-Ferrand ISFF. \\\\n• Agora collaborates and hosts the EWA Mentoring Program bringing to Thessaloniki emerging female producers and their mentors. \\\\n• Agora TV Series will be inaugurated slowly but surely from the next edition with panels, open discussions, masterclasses, showcases, etc.\\\\n\\\\nAGORA SUMMARY:\\\\n•\\\\tAgora guests: 429 from 43 countries\\\\n•\\\\tFilm Market: 153 films from 51 countries, 2142 viewings \\\\n•\\\\tCrossroads Co-production Forum: 14 projects from 15 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tDot.on.the.map: 2 projects from 3 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tCineuropa Mini Co-production Market: 2 Italian projects from 4 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Works in Progress: 8 films from 10 countries (including co-productions)\\\\n•\\\\tThessaloniki Locarno Industry Academy: 8 participants from 5 different countries\\\\n•\\\\tEWA Mentoring Program: 8 mentors \\\\u0026 8 participants from 13 different countries\\\\n•\\\\tMeet the Future: 7 Greek Film Editors\\\\n•\\\\tAgora films in the Official Program: 9\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Awards: 12\\\\n•\\\\tAgora Talks: 8\",\"finalResults\":\"Impact and results of the 2021 Thessaloniki IFF AGORA:\\\\n\\\\nThe AGORA of the 62nd Thessaloniki IFF took place November 5-14 2021 in Thessaloniki \\\\u0026 Online. Due to the ongoing COVID – 19 pandemic the industry section was organized in a hybrid format. The total number of Agora Accredited guests was 429 from 43 different countries. The total number of PHYSICAL accredited guests was 259 -of which 136 international guests- and 83 online of which 70 internationals. In the online 2020 edition we had overall 414 online guests from 45 different countries.\\\\n\\\\nAGORA’s structuring approach from development to completed films and its impact on the region’s film industry is more and more visible as the projects we select and support circulate in the European film markets in their various stages of production and when complete they are selected in Festivals and distributed worldwide. Agora has been steadily turning Thessaloniki into the Fall’s Meeting Point for European films with a specific focus on Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, for all the right reasons.\\\\n\\\\nWe support the projects we have selected in development with advice and follow ups. We check when they are in post-production to see if they can be part of the Agora Works in Progress. If the timeline does not allow this, we offer advice on other suitable markets. \\\\n\\\\nChanges in our impact analysis would be to find advisors in the focus countries to suggest new projects from talented directors and their new projects. To network with the directors who have been selected to the Meet the Neighbors Competition of the Thessaloniki IFF and follow up on their new projects. To be more active on scouting new projects from awarded directors from our region. To focus more on genre films.\\\\n\\\\nIn the hybrid edition of the 62nd TIFF we presented nine films in the program that were part of the various AGORA activities, six of them were in the competition sections. \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, 5 out of the 8 selected films for the Agora Works in Progress 2022 previously participated at Crossroads Co-production Forum. \\\\n\\\\nCrossroads Co-production Forum counts 124 completed films since 2005 and Agora Works in Progress 118 since 2010.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-08-24\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-08-23\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053080', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053080/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': \"Filem'On -

The Summit Group of top industry professionals as well as the newly installed board keep its finger on the pulse of the rapidly evolving market.\\\\n\\\\nSERIAL EYES’ full-time, intensive programme equips young screenwriters to make the most of growing opportunities in this field through targeted teaching with hands-on assignments to teach dramaturgical and narrative strategies used in successful fiction series. \\\\n\\\\nParticipants’ collaborative work is central; the Writers’ Room workshop run by Frank Spotnitz (The X-Files) offers experience of working as a team and assuming the head writer role. Participants conceive and develop an individual, original series concept as well as a TV pilot and group projects in conjunction with industry partners. US and European showrunners, head writers, producers and commissioning editors share their experience (through mentoring/lectures/practical writing and pitching exercises). Workshops (UK/ Sweden) introduce participants to 2 major European markets with well-functioning, mature TV systems. A study trip to Séries Mania boosts networking with industry e.g. individual meetings with producers/commissioning editors. The SE Final Pitch at the end of each year’s programme in May offers an excellent platform for SE participants to pitch their work to broadcasters and network with industry professionals from many European countries. \\\\n\\\\nThe main postgraduate programme is complemented by a 10-week online Short Form Series screenwriting workshop in diverse storytelling to help emerging talents from less traditional screenwriting backgrounds and LGBTQ+ communities hone their skills.\\\\n\\\\nWebsite Serial Eyes: www.serial-eyes.com\\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SerialEyes/\\\\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/serial-eyes\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The Serial Eyes programme of studies is structured to intermesh theory and practice, as well as incorporating insights from industry professionals in masterclasses/workshops (in 2022 this included masterclases with showrunners like Susannah Grant “Unbelievable”, Jörg Winger “Deutschland 89” or Jantje Friese “Dark” ).

We are confident that this will also be the case for the alumni who have just completed this year’s programme in June.\\\\n\\\\nThis year participants worked on gripping individual projects; this entailed project development, as well as presentation to industry partners in the Midterm Pitch and responding to their feedback. These projects and contacts stand them in good stead as they continue to build their careers after the programme. Work on the group project also fosters teamwork skills with specific reference to the challenging process of devising and interweaving powerful narrative strands within a Writers‘ Room context. Extensive industry input and networking contacts ensures the programme reflects real-world concerns and issues.

According to the 2019 census, the population of the municipality is 5.892. \\\\nThe area of the Municipality of Puconci is where the sub-regions Ravensko and Goričko meet. The northern part of the municipality is much more hilly than the southern part, which stretches from the Lendava terrace to the flatlands. The hilly area of the municipality – covering 67% or 7.202 hectares of land – is part of the Goričko Nature Park, for it is a significant cultural landscape, which falls under protected natural and cultural areas by international standards. On 9 October 2003 the nature park became a protected area of national significance and in 2004 it was included into the Natura 2000 – the European ecological network of protected areas. The shape of the municipality resembles a rhombus, the northern part of which tilts towards the southeast.

The activities were mainly dedicated to culture and cultural dialogue in connection with traditional couisine. Our partner cities also have a similar cultural heritage, thus contributing to a dynamic European identity. The cuisine also shows the culture, especially our traditional, local dishes, so we decided to cook together our typical dish, dödole and the traditional dishes from our partner cities. In the evening we organised in the memorial house a round table on the theme of cultural differences and similarities of both nations. Present were speakers from Puconci, Zabok and Prelog from the cultural field of working. We compared our elements of cultural heritage and discussed on possible future common projects and events to promote the Slovene and Croatian culture to the wider European surrounding.\\\\nThe next day, the 28.8.2022 we organised a culture event with folk dancers from both partner cities. We presented to the wider audience traditional dances from Slovenia and Croatia.\\\\n\\\\nOn the 24.9.2022 we organised a round table about Europe and current events. The debate covered topics such as the current situation in the EU and how satisfied we are, what kind of Europe we want, how to promote intercultural dialogue and tolerance, and respect common values and history. Students prepared a program with workshops and an exhibition on the theme of the Day for Connection and Solidarity. In this way children and young people were encouraged to tolerance, friendship, coexistence and respectful relationships. \\\\n\\\\nOn the 25.9.2022 was a lecture with a student from Macedonia who is attending Puconci Primary School. He presented his thoughts about both countries. According to the present fear of war elementary school students participated in an evacuation exercise at a sign of danger. After that the event was followed by socializing over dinner and music, including musical inserts and presentations from partner countries.\\\\n\\\\nThe current situation in Europe is not easy. Not far from us, there is a war going on in Ukraine, where innocent people are suffering because of politics. People are fleeing in all directions, so we feel the invasion of refugees from Ukraine on our soil as well. The municipality of Puconci also donated food products and technical equipment to the city of Polyana from Ukraine.\\\\nEven our sister cities are feeling the war in Ukraine and are joining the actions of helping Ukraine.\\\\n\\\\nOn the 15.10.2022 we organised a professional lecture on how to deal with Covid-19 and how to help curb the pandemic although Covid-19 is not as present as one year ago. We organized a cultural event in which partner cities actively participated and told how they lived in these corona times. The next day, on the 16.10.2022 we organised a hike around the villages of the Municipality Puconci to promote a healthy life style.\\\\n\\\\nThrough the events, we achieved that the culture was mixed between different nationalities. Friendly ties were strengthened and new ties between different nations were established. New skills were acquired, as the way of singing, dancing and, last but not least, cuisine is different from country to country. In this way, experiences and opinions were also exchanged.

Every October we organise Cinekid Festival, a multidisciplinary event containing Film, Series, and New Media sections and media industry event Cinekid for Professionals. \\nCinekid Film Festival offers a wide diverse programme, emphasizing productions from European countries, which have a strong children’s film tradition. Films are not just screened but presented in a media-literacy framework. In-dept masterclasses and workshops are organized in connection to the films and together with Q&As they allow children to interact with the work and attending talent.  School screenings are hosted at the beginning of the festival, accompanied by custom-made educational material, introducing new audiences to our festival from an early age. \\nSimultaneously with the Amsterdam festival, Cinekid presents localized festivals with films, school screenings, and workshops at ca. 40 theatres all over the Netherlands. Throughout the year our online platform Cinekid Play, educational film catalogue, and interactive activities help us reach children across the country. On an international scale, Cinekid for Professionals promotes the circulation of European films.\\nFor our 35th and 36th editions, we will further develop our programme, while continuing to select with ambition, focusing on quality and geography diversity. MEDIA support is essential to reach these goals, as it allows us to strengthen our programme, increase visibility throughout the country and improve our impact year-round; maintaining our role as a guiding festival that gives new films, talent, and innovative initiatives a chance and enthuses the next generation for European film.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053110'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-FEST'], 'overallBudget': ['82000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":946970164,\"legalName\":\"STICHTING CINEKID AMSTERDAM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"1018 JA\",\"street\":\"KATTENBURGERSTRAAT 5 GEBOUW 003-G\",\"city\":\"Amsterdam\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"NL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Netherlands\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"52.36483835\",\"longitude\":\"4.914516336215238\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"82000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['CK2021-2022'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:08.769+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053110/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053110/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['82000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:08.692+0200'], 'topicId': ['44041896'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053110'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053110_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"The Cinekid Foundation believes that films are a valuable part of our shared culture that offers children and young people a window on the world around them. Films invites children to reflect on and discuss previously unknown topics and encourages children to develop their critical senses. It is therefore important to give children access to high quality productions from around Europe because these films broaden their view of the world, make them curious about other people\\\\u0027s stories and helps to appreciate all kinds of art in the future. As a long running children’s film festival, Cinekid Film Festival believes itself to be a quality label for children media productions in the Netherlands. Every October we feel a responsibility to present a wide-ranging and diverse film programme. We want to engage children with a film festival that contains a wide variety of high-quality audio-visual productions from as many different countries as possible. When selecting films, Cinekid Film Festival doesn’t want to only screen films that are easily available, instead we want to expand on the available children’s film in The Netherlands by presenting new high-quality titles from all over the world, including many that would not otherwise get presented in cinemas. We want to showcase productions from underrepresented regions, films with challenging topics, and forms of children’s cinema that are less commercially viable, such as youth documentaries and short films. Cinekid wants to reach all the children in the Netherlands. It’s therefore important to emphasize that Cinekid Film Festival takes place nationwide. Simultaneously Cinekid presents smaller Cinekid Festivals with current festival programming, accompanying school screenings and connected workshops at ca. 40 theatres all over the Netherlands. The Film Festival also doesn’t stop after October, but Cinekid has developed various educational initiatives and online platforms, such as Cinekid Play, intended to connect with children through the year.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"How fortunate that the Cinekid Festival could physically take place in October 2021, thanks to the newly introduced corona app and tests for access! It was great to let children enjoy the films, the MediaLab and all (partly) free indoor and outdoor meetings and activities together with their parents and carers without social distancing. The main location in Amsterdam Noord was a brand new place where we programmed together with Noorderlingen. Eventhough the location in Amsterdam-Noord was new, we managed to bring back our audience to the cinema in Amsterdam, and throughout the country! Many new schools have also discovered our festival, as evidenced by the record number of visitors to the school program in Amsterdam. The opening film Captain Nova by Michiel Trouwborst (De Rules van Floor) was received with great enthusiasm by the public and media and won the two jury prizes for Best Children\\\\u0027s Film. There were many (inter)national premieres: like the animated series Anansi de Spin. And not only in Amsterdam. Cinekid Festival took place throughout the country, with eight large and more than 26 small locations in the region. The festival could also be experienced from the living room. Via our digital platform Cinekid Play, our online visitors had access to a selection of the festival content for eight euros. And there was the Cinekid Festival Box, with which children started working from home to make their own thaumatrope and to do countless mini workshops together with friends and family. In addition to the festival, it was unfortunately very limited possible in 2021 to develop the year-round physical activities. This was partly due to the closing of the film theaters, our partners. The year-round activities therefore mainly took place in digital forms, together with Pathe.nl, Cinekid Play and our social media channels, among others. Our online school program was also used intensively.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 Cinekid Festival was back like before In Amsterdam North on the Buiksloterplein and across the country at 28 locations. It was the second year at the Buikslotermeerplein in North Amsterdam. With the relatively new team, a festival was set up with a beautiful visible campaign, where, in addition to the Dutch public, international professionals were also present at the Amsterdam main location. In addition to Amsterdam, the opening film Totem also drew full houses at the national locations and resulted in many great conversations after the school performances. The special program around Guest of the Year Burny Bos celebrated the timeless quality of his many youth productions and inspired many new audiences and, not unimportantly, many new makers to start making youth content as well.\",\"finalResults\":\"In 2021 it quickly became clear that the hope of recovery and the possibility of reconciliation after the first year of the pandemic remained very limited. After half a year of the closure of cinemas, film theatres, festivals and cultural activities, there was a brief revival in which visits, limited, became possible again. Unfortunately, this \\\\u0027summer of love\\\\u0027 was short-lived and the corona app and tests for access caused a lot of unrest. The Cinekid festival in October certainly experienced the necessary effects of this, as the introduction of the corona app for cinema visits was only introduced two weeks before the start of the festival. But it was great to receive our audience without 1.5 meters after entering. A huge happiness. After all, not long after that, the Netherlands was locked again and unfortunately no physical meeting was possible in the cultural sector.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022 many of Cinekid Festival\\\\u0027s most prominent team members thought it was time for something new. Therefore the festival in 2022 was organized by many new team members. t was the second year at the Buikslotermeerplein in North Amsterdam. We grew our audience and the involvement of children in our festival was intensified, which reseulted in a beautiful visible campaign. We have chosen to focus on physical encounters during the festival. The period of recovery in the festival sector is still in full swing. Public behavior has changed and is still evolving. It was therefore exciting to see whether the audience was able to find their way back and whether the new path that Cinekid has taken; to be really accessible and to shape the festival together with our audience has paid off. The number of visits approached our record-breaking 2019, only 11% lower than in the pre-corona year.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nThroughout the year, Cinekid organized high impact programs at school and in collaboration with various partners. The growth in those activities is considerable, doubling in a year\\\\u0027s time. The digital activities developed by Cinekid were an extension of the festival\\\\u0027s activities last year. Digital platform Cinekid Play streamed a selection of short films throughout the year, as well as tips for games and apps to do at home. There was intensive collaboration with digital partners such as Scula and Lesson Up to bring Cinekid workshops to children\\\\u0027s homes and schools. And research was done in the field of innovation. The digital transition has been scrutinized again: how can Cinekid be relevant within its digital mission now that the urgency of lockdowns has disappeared? What will Cinekid develop itself? Where are the needs?\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-12-31\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053090', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053090/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '409FFC762BB3A55B8BDD15861EED75A6148705D349B7FADF3A61710ED83274DD', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.035+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-11-30T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['JEF festival 2022 and JEF festival 2023'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053090_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Catalogue 2022\",\"description\":\"Print \\\\u0026 online.

Although often thought of as an invariant representation of active nociceptors, pain varies a lot under the influence of different affective states, sometimes with near complete analgesia. Such modulation of pain is thought to occur through a descending pathway originating in the brain and to be executed by Rostral Ventromedial Medulla (RVM) neurons that project to the spinal cord. Deciphering the complexity of the cell types involved and how they contribute to the descending control of pain has been challenging, but recent advances in single-cell omics, computational biology and advanced genetic technologies now open for unbiased system-wide insights.\\n\\nDescendPain will uncover the power of the brain to control pain. We will classify RVM neuron types by single-cell RNA-sequencing and use scRNAseq-based stimulus-to-cell-type mapping to identify neuronal ensembles conferring analgesia and hyperalgesia during morphine, naloxone, stress, sleep-deprivation and exercise. Using activity-based mouse genetics, we will reveal the full complexity of the combinations of neurons engaged and unravel their role in pain modulation, thus identifying for the first time the cellular basis for how affective states modulate pain. We will also use novel intersectional strategies for dual capturing of active neurons to determine how the descending RVM controls the transmission of pain in the ascending pathway of the spinal cord. Finally, we will identify the memory substrate underlying chronic pain, providing evidence for the existence of RVM neuron ensembles of chronic pain and revealing underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. \\n\\nThis project takes a new system-wide strategy in the pain field that should fundamentally change the view of pain, by providing a cellular basis for how it is continuously scaled by mental states and uncovering mechanisms of chronic pain, which may provide strategies for designing effective pain therapies.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['single cell RNA-sequencing', ' somatosensation', ' chronic pain'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053091'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2500000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999978530,\"legalName\":\"KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"17177\",\"street\":\"Nobels Vag 5\",\"city\":\"Stockholm\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Sweden\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"59.496510549999996\",\"longitude\":\"18.22277924122159\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2500000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['DescendPain'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.715+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053091/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053091/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2500000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-02T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:05.698+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101053091'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2023-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053102', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053102/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'FABIAN', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'FABIAN', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '9C7E6D9C20DE23999657CA854B93B16F349D85BD834B6D53A5AA2518EAF70720', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Project Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:07.654+0200'], 'endDate': ['2022-12-31T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['FABIAN'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053102_3_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Marketing Material\",\"description\":\"Link to promotional material: \\\\n\\\\nPresskit (English), Poster (English), Trailer (English subs), Stills :\\\\n\\\\nhttps://filmsdulosange.com/en/film/fabian/\\\\nTeasers (English subs):\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/v/39KypeN3U/\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/v/5ANpTiC0M/\\\\nhttps://fb.watch/\\\\n\\\\nMarketing material adapted by Distributor\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project Coordination and Sales agent costs\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-06-16\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5fd2c0ee0/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['9C7E6D9C20DE23999657CA854B93B16F349D85BD834B6D53A5AA2518EAF70720'], 'objective': [\"Selected to the very prestigious Official Competition of the Berlinale 2021 (which had a special edition this year due to the pandemic and took place in two parts: first an online premiere in March 2021, followed by the first physical screening during Berlinale Summer Special in June 2021), Fabian by Dominik Graf has started a worldwide journey, within and beyond the European borders. As the first laudatory reviews launched the career of the film, many European distributors have noticed its potential. Both the strength of its mise en scene and the great performance of the actresses and actors performing in Fabian were greatly acclaimed by the international press. \\n“Berlin, 1931, Jakob Fabian works in the advertising department of a cigarette factory during the day and drifts through bars, brothels and artist studios with his wealthy friend Labude at night. When Fabian gets to know the self-confident Cornelia, he manages to shed his pessimistic attitude for a brief moment. He falls in love. But then he too falls victim to the great wave of layoffs, while Cornelia makes a career as an actress thanks to her boss and admirer. An arrangement that Fabian finds difficult to come to terms with. But it's not just his world that is falling apart...”\\nThis period drama describes a crucial time in Europe: the rise of Nazism during the interwar period, a European common past that Fabian’s producers, sales agent, and distributors all share. Lately, sanitary and socio-economic crisis tend to threat some of our European values. Eighteen distributors gathered to decide a pan-European strategy to present this acclaimed movie to the European audience.

CfP initially organised seminars, an international conference, co-production markets and network meetings. Later the ScreeningClub followed; a ‘video library’ with hundreds of titles that draws buyers and programmers from all over the world. Today CfP attracts more than 500 media professionals from 40 different countries and, aside from in-depth conferences and network opportunities, offers more than 350 screenings. The event is seen as the leading platform for the international youth media industry.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"After an online edition in 2020, we organized Cinekid for Professionals (CfP) 2021 in a hybrid form. Our guests were able to attend in Amsterdam, but also from home in our online environment. In total, CfP had 546 visitors, 149 attended online and 387 visitors came to Amsterdam to attend the program live. The program was rated with an average of 8 (on a scale of 10) by the guests (impact research was done by Cigarbox). An important and unique element of CfP is that it takes place simultaneously with the Cinekid Festival. This provides opportunities for participants and projects to make contact with the target group, for input on their projects in the development phase. Insight into the target group is very important to us, which is why we had a session in the Industry Forum (conference programme) with children, who told more about their experience and how they watch films and series. In 2021, Kids Kino Industry and CfP joined forces to launch Producers LINK, a newly established program for emerging children\\\\u0027s content producers to stimulate co-production between Eastern and Western Europe. CfP also remains the place where the industry can meet in an informal atmosphere. A place for exchange, inspiration, groundbreaking projects (both in form and in themes), where interdisciplinary is stimulated and a place where young talents and experienced makers are connected. Talent development is an important spearhead in this respect and our Script LAB (screenwriter program) and Directors LAB (director program) are growing every year. In 2021 we also collaborate with ROSE Stories Writersroom and FilmForward Vrijplaats (Young Perspectives), two talent initiative programmes who both focus mainly on autodidacts and people who aspire to create in media feel like their stories need to be told.\",\"finalResults\":\"Young audiences are the industry\\\\u0027s future audience. Working with the children and youth audience implies that the impact of present action is extremely far reaching and does not involve only current participants and projects but the entirety of the audiovisual industry in a very long term perspective.The Cinekid Foundation applies a holistic approach when it comes to serving the audiovisual industry and its young audience. Our contribution targets creation, production as well as promotion and our action has a structuring effect for the whole industry in the specific sub sector addressing children and youth. We start with creation through our pioneering training programmes:  the Cinekid Script LAB, an international workshop aimed at screenwriters; work towards the production in the Cinekid Directors LAB, an international workshop aimed at directors;  ZappDoc LAB (national documentary workshop for directors, supported by the Dutch broadcasting fund NPO-fonds and Dutch broadcaster NPO Zapp). We support production by facilitating projects to find new sources of financing in our efficient Junior Co- production Market (JCM), fostering new collaborations and co-creation in our newly shaped Producers LINK programme and boosting networking, news business developments and co-creation in our inspiring conference programme the Industry Forum. Finally,  our contribution to promotion and circulation is done through Cinekids very own efficient buyers and sellers platform, the ScreeningClub, and of course the Cinekid Festival (for which a complementary application has been granted in the Call European Festivals). We support projects in the entire chain of development. This holistic approach gives a production the right quality label, promotion and springboard to take off to other major festivals and to be acquired for international distribution.\\\\nSince the start of our Junior Co-production Market in 2004, Script LAB in 2014 and Directors LAB in 2021, over 45% of the projects that have been selected for these programmes have either premiered at major European film festivals, screened on global streaming platforms, broadcasted on television or are currently in (post-)production. \\\\nCinekid gives lots of importance to the collection and analysis of data. The long series of historical data  provides us with a deep insight of the industry evolution and new trends. In particular, we know about the success and market performance of our participants by closely keeping in touch with the children’s media industry, potential participants and most importantly former participants of our programmes. An additional way to measure the impact of our programmes is the rate of returning participants or production companies with their projects. \\\\nWe reach out to the audiovisual community that’s working with a children and youth’s audience, through our partners, ambassadors and our network. They are mainly European and support us in our action to strengthen the European children and youth’s media industry. They act as ambassadors and identify new and upcoming European professionals for us to invite and/or make them aware of our action. We also reach out to international institutes  who support producers to attend Cinekid and spread our calls for entries and accreditations.\\\\nCinekid has a solid structuring effect on the European audio-visual industry as a whole (children and youth subsector) mainly through the annual forum that brings together all the main European producers, financiers, buyers, sales agents, branding companies and others working in the children’s media industry for a focused meeting programme with various events. The event is not a coyuntural occasion but has continuity throughout the year by several means. Since the industry and the audience needs to develop so quickly we want to shift more from an annual momentum to events and more visibility throughout the year. We actively serve as matchmakers at different festivals and international markets, online and in person. We make sure to deliver industry information and insights via our platform. We make sure to link the right people to each other in order to set-up pan- European collaboration. We are a platform with a showcase function and in everything we do we want to stimulate the European/International Children’s Media Industry; by promoting films, stimulating co- productions, sharing knowledge and bringing professionals together.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2021-05-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2022-04-30\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null}]'], 'status': ['Ended']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053100', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053100/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '4189E343CFB482F971D2535178B7394FE571A72AE31D399D9B7FCECFE34F99CC', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:07.318+0200'], 'endDate': ['2024-09-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['Xilam Animation - Slate Media Dev 2021'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['4189E343CFB482F971D2535178B7394FE571A72AE31D399D9B7FCECFE34F99CC'], 'objective': ['\"Le catalogue de projet présenté par Xilam Animation est composé de 5 projets de série d\\'animation :\\n\\n- \"\"Toddl\\'Heroes\"\" : une série comique en 3D\\n- \"\"Potobot\"\" : une série qui vise à sensibiliser les enfants à la protection de l\\'environnement\\n- \"\"Retour à la Terre\"\" : une série adaptée de la BD éponyme \\n- \"\"Phil & Sophia\"\" : une série 100% éducative basée sur la philosophie\\n- \"\"Piggy Builders\"\" : une série préscolaire en 3D\\n\\n\"\"Phil & Sophia\"\" sera produite par Xilam Animation.

This represents a crucial & fantastic audience for both national and non-national European films throughout our continent. Even beyond, just considering how many libraries there are in the world. Still, one main issue remains: many of these European films are still only available for rent as one single DVD or Blu-ray per European library (!), if available at all - while European citizens - and further citizens - have been used for years now to get access to films using online digital platforms with flat offers – like from big American platforms to get access to few European films. We as filmfriend, an established European digital flat fee film solution for libraries, as well as company fond of European films, believe there still is a big online forgotten marketplace in the European Union, and that we, as Europeans, should be first to invest in: the European online film market for libraries. Investing in this market would mean supporting the European film industry on a further audience market, strengthening the online digital European film offer towards a real significant number of European users, as well as encouraging cultural exchange and the values of the European Union. In 2017, we launched filmfriend in Germany with only 1 library. Just a few years later, we count almost 400 European libraries participating, not only in Germany but also in Austria & Switzerland, making filmfriend already available for 3,000,000 users in Europe! Thanks to the Creative Europe programme, we already started to work last year on further expansion on the EU territory, adding French and Dutch-speaking territories (BE, Lux, FR, NL) to our “targets” as well as English-speaking ones like UK and Ireland.

These include supporting emerging European talents, increasing the quality of feature films and drama series production, and providing training on skills critical for adaptation in a rapidly changing environment.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, MIDPOINT Institute\\\\u0027s proposed activities aimed at providing comprehensive training and support to talents in the Region were successful. Over 110 talented individuals received complex training designed to enhance their skills and capabilities in their respective fields. The outreach events organized as part of the initiative were also highly effective, with over 100 talents trained through vocational consultations and workshops in conjunction with various festivals and markets or independently.\\\\n\\\\nWhat sets MIDPOINT Institute apart is the complexity of the training offered, combined with access to market opportunities. Its Feature Launch and Series Launch programs hold a unique position in the market as the only European training programs providing comprehensive project and skills development training focused on an early stage of development.

In addition, the organization also conducted its follow-up modules, including Company Time, Editing Room, and Next Season.\\\\nThe Feature Launch program was designed to provide in-depth training to writers, producers, and directors working on their first or second feature films. The program consisted of two residential workshops, in Prague and Karlovy Vary, with the final presentation of projects and an award of 10 000 EUR for the best project in development. The program also included two online workshops to provide comprehensive project development support for the participants.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, the Series Launch program was designed to support writers, producers, and directors emerging from film to series production. The program consisted of three residential workshops: in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with the final workshop and presentation of projects within the Industry@Tallinn and Baltic Event. Additional online support during the workshop was provided to the participants who received comprehensive training from industry experts.\\\\n\\\\nEach program was opened to 9 teams of writers, producers, and directors with feature films or long-form series projects in development. Also, three script consultant trainees (Feature Launch) and development executive participants (Series Launch) followed the whole development training for each program. They were trained for their future careers as script consultants or commissioning editors.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the follow-up modules, including Company Time, Editing Room, and Next Season, were designed to provide additional support to the Feature Launch and Series Launch program participants. Company Time allowed participants to focus on their companies with the support of experienced mentors. In contrast, the Editing Room gave them dramaturgical feedback on their rough cuts. Lastly, the online module Next Season was designed to help participants refine the development and production strategies of sustainable film and series production.\",\"finalResults\":\"MIDPOINT Institute\\\\u0027s Feature Launch and Series Launch programs and follow-up modules Company Time, Next Season, and Editing Room have significantly impacted the participants, their projects, the companies involved, and the European audiovisual sector a whole.\\\\n\\\\nPrograms have enabled participants to acquire new skills and expertise and develop a compelling, competitive development portfolio for feature films or scripted fiction series. The programs have also provided them with deep insights into the professional development process and tools to efficiently find a place for themselves in the competitive workforce. Participants have better understood good practices, allowing them to compete and access better in their respective Regional and European markets, which has helped expand their professional network and build important relationships.\\\\n\\\\nIhe main objective of MIDPOINT Institute in terms of content is to support the creation of high-quality writing and explore strong local stories that can be universally understood while still respecting the author\\\\u0027s intention. The programs encourage the development of \\\\\"glocal\\\\\" projects, which have a better chance of becoming international co-productions and finding new creative options for their financing models. International program set-ups also lead to greater possibilities when considering distribution territories. Participants were encouraged to consider new distribution channels, including European or VOD platforms or other business and financing partners.\\\\n\\\\nCompanies participating in the programs learned how to position themselves within the local and transnational industry and access a wider network via their tutors, experts, and attending professionals during and beyond the programs. They acquired financing models, an understanding of context, and the position of the European audiovisual industry enables them to deliver the content of greater value and interest to the international industry. Participants also gained skills in company development, thus gaining the know-how to lead a sustainable business. Companies that work within the film and television industry benefited from the participants having a healthier and more realistic idea of the current state of affairs.\\\\n\\\\nMIDPOINT Feature Launch and Series Launch programs and their follow-up modules have become assets for the Regional and European audiovisual sector, offering a portfolio of trained emerging professionals thoroughly developed projects with international potential from the Region.

Experience with process-simulation based scale-up shows that these uncertainties will likely result in large additional costs and delays.\\nTo improve the description of properties of hydrogen and to enable the application of advanced lique-faction concepts, fundamental breakthroughs are required with regard to the metrology of fluids at cryogenic temperatures and with regard to accurate modelling of these complex systems – ThermoPro-pHy addresses this pioneering scientific work. Experimental equipment will be developed that allows for highly accurate measurements of density and speed of sound at temperatures down to the triple point of hydrogen (14 K), far below current temperature limits. Property models will be developed that yield a highly accurate and consistent description of arbitrary mixtures of ortho- and parahydrogen for the first time, including the effects of the temperature dependent ortho/para-equilibrium. Solid phases of impurities affecting large-scale liquefaction processes will be described by models that are con-sistent to accurate fluid-phase models. Measurements and modelling of mixtures of helium, neon, and argon will establish an accurate basis for the application of mixed fluid cascade (MFC) processes for hydrogen liquefaction.\\nThermoPropHy will result not only in scientific breakthroughs with regard to the metrology of fluids and to accurate modelling of thermodynamic properties, but also in increased accuracy and credibility of process simulations for hydrogen technologies.'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['hydrogen', ' hydrogen transport', ' hydrogen storage', ' hydrogen processing', ' thermodynamic properties', ' cryogenic mixtures'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43108390101053133'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['ERC-2021-ADG'], 'overallBudget': ['2457146'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999988812,\"legalName\":\"RUHR-UNIVERSITAET BOCHUM\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"44801\",\"street\":\"UNIVERSITAETSSTRASSE 150\",\"city\":\"Bochum\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"51.4456125\",\"longitude\":\"7.2610298\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"2457146\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'programmeDivision': ['43108406', '43108394'], 'crossCuttingPriorities': [], 'acronym': ['ThermoPropHy'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:13.848+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['100'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053133/HORIZON'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101053133/HORIZON'], 'euContributionAmount': ['2457146'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-17T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:13.830+0200'], 'topicId': ['43518411'], 'programDescription': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Horizon Europe (HORIZON)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['HORIZON'], 'projectId': ['101053133'], 'programId': ['43108390'], 'startDate': ['2022-10-01T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053135', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053135/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': '5CDAA4D52694E934E76C32A76D67844754008823FA421EBC60CD8B7AFF051391', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:14.034+0200'], 'endDate': ['2024-08-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['DEVELOPMENT SLATE NGF 2021'], 'deliverables': ['[]'], 'esST_checksum': ['5CDAA4D52694E934E76C32A76D67844754008823FA421EBC60CD8B7AFF051391'], 'objective': [\"The slate consists of five fictional film projects with very different genres, formats and target groups.

In breast cancer, aggressiveness correlates with fibrotic stiffening of the tumour. There is an urgent need to understand how the fibrotic microenvironment evolves, to design better targeted cancer therapies. Fibrotic stiffening is caused by fibroblasts secretion of a matrix with mechanical properties that stabilise the tumour vascular network. However, the hierarchy and stability of the tumour vascular network are not reproducible in vitro. To advance the field, I will develop a revolutionary platform able to recapitulate tumour fibrosis by exploiting the vascularisation of a living organism.\\nTo achieve my goal, I will use human breast cancer cells adhering to 3D polymeric micro scaffolds to create arrays of tumour micro environments. I will implant the arrays in vivo in the chorioallantoic membrane of an embryonated avian egg, to elicit a foreign-body fibrotic reaction. I will vary the micro scaffolds geometry to condition tumour infiltration by the host’s vessels and cells. I will exploit fluorescent spatial beacons incorporated in the micro scaffolds for multiphoton image correlation, to derive morphological and functional information of the regenerated fibrous matrix and vessels.

GFF presented its 45th edition on Jan 28 - Feb 6, 2022, and its 46th edition on Jan 27 - Feb 5, 2023, the first two editions of the festival that offered cinematic experiences to the audience both in cinemas and at home.\\\\n\\\\nThe 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival presented a diverse and high-quality program of about 200 relevant films annually. The festival continued to promote its competition programmes and to put the spotlight on talents, debutants as well as masters, and drew among others attention to internationally acclaimed artistry by handing out three honorary awards during the period, to the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson and the Swedish director Jan Troell.\\\\n\\\\nAn important aim was to be a vibrant arena for meetings and discussions and GFF did therefore invite directors, producers, and actors to come and meet the audience. In 2022, GFF was forced to limit the number of invitations, due to the pandemic, but did still welcome over one hundred talents. In 2023, GFF could once again welcome talents from all over world.\\\\n\\\\nThe 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival hosted the annual film market, Nordic Film Market, which today is the most important meeting place for an international film industry with an interest in films from the five Nordic countries. Nordic Film Market is a launch pad for Nordic films to reach out to international film festivals and international TV and cinema distribution. Nordic Film Market was accessible both on-site in Göteborg and from all over the world on the festival’s own digital platform. GFF also continued to arrange its one-year networking forum, Nordic Film Lab, open to producers, directors and screenwriters from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the main festival, GFF continued to arrange its satellite events: Göteborg Film Festival Prisma (Children\\\\u0027s film festival in October) and Göteborg Film Festival Open Air, as well as continued with its all-year activities with regional and avant-premiere screenings together with an extensive workshop program for children and schools in the region of Västra Götaland.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"The main achievement of the 45th and 46th Göteborg Film Festival was to successfully implement hybrid editions of the festival. GFF constantly strives to disseminate its program to attract new audiences, and to make the festival more accessible. Through the digital program GFF becomes relevant for audiences in Sweden regardless of where they reside. At the same time, GFF wants to continue to value the collective experience of watching films together in cinemas. A combination of the two objectives were manifested at the inauguration of both GFF 2022 and 2023, where the opening night film celebrated its world premiere simultaneously on the festival’s digital platform as well as in more than 70 cinemas located all around Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nGFF 2022 displayed a program of 202 films (152 features and 50 shorts), presented in 15 sections. The films originated from 74 different countries, of which 31 were European MEDIA countries. Out of 157 European films, 105 were of non-national origin. GFF 2023 displayed a program of 225 films (176 features and 49 shorts), presented in 14 sections. The films originated from 73 different countries, of which 34 were European MEDIA countries. Out of 188 European films, 120 were of non-national origin. Five sections presented the competition line-up (42 films in 2022 and 49 films in 2023), and annually, one section introduced the thematic focus of the year. In 2022, 46% of the films screened had a female director and in 2023, 48% of the films had a female director.\\\\n\\\\nGFF offered its audience about 550 screenings in 16 cinemas in 2022 and 700 screenings in 18 cinemas in 2023. The digital program presented about 50 films annually to audiences all over Sweden. Thanks to the digital program, GFF could maintain its large audience despite the Omicron-outbreak that reached its peak in Sweden during the festival week in 2022. Every online screening was introduced by a festival host together with a greeting from the filmmakers.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with the screenings, every edition of GFF presented a large number of moderated talks and Q\\\\u0026A’s. A few guests, like the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, Austrian director Marie Kreutzer, French director Lucile Hadzihalilovic and Romanian director Radu Jude also held public master classes. Some of the master classes were recorded and published on the festival’s social platforms. For the recipient of the honorary awards GFF also arranged retrospective screenings to celebrate their artistry. Beyond the talks in cinemas, GFF broadcasted a live talk show, Studio Draken, and a podcast every day.\",\"finalResults\":\"At times when the size of the audience at cinemas has decreased due to the pandemic, GFF, thanks to the online program, has managed to increase its audience in total. The great interest for the festival’s digital program clearly shows that the festival is on the right path strategically. The festival’s investments in enhancing the streaming experience, the tableau format that points out every single film premiere, the introductions by the filmmakers, and the extensive material with interviews through the festival’s podcast and Studio Draken, reaches out to extensive audiences all over Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nGöteborg Film Festival has continued working on finding films from as many European countries as possible. The main reason is that GFF firmly believes in diversity as an aspect of quality. GFF is carefully monitoring the European festivals and markets (both the major and smaller ones) that are important launch pads for new projects. GFF programmers are attending as many European festivals and markets as possible, cover others digitally, and then get in touch directly with the filmmakers or representatives.\\\\n\\\\nGöteborg Film Festival is an important launch pad for films from the five Nordic countries, why these always have a prominent place in the festival. About 2000 professionals visited the festival in 2023. The festival’s annual market, Nordic Film Market, arranged market screenings of completed Nordic films, work in progress presentations of Nordic films in post-production and presentations of Nordic projects in development. To help the circulation of European works after the festival, partnership with digital distributors is essential. Göteborg Film Festival’s streaming platform, Draken Film, obtain most of its films from the festival program. In 2022, Draken Film also started distributing European films for cinema and VOD-release in Sweden.\\\\n\\\\nSustainability work\\\\nIn 2022 and 2023, GFF continued to adapt its activities and events to meet sustainability requirements and minimize negative environmental impact. GFF urged all invited Scandinavian guests to travel by train or bus to Göteborg. Food and refreshments provided by the festival was ecological and mainly vegetarian, no meat was served.

EDT is the continuation of the eponym project, supported by Creative Europe in 2020-21.\\nCoordinated by VOD aggregator Under the Milky Way International (UMWI), EDT is the result of our 11 years of experience in digital distribution; working with 600 rights holders and a library of 6,000 films. Over the years, we witnessed the emergence of increasingly creative films, financed outside of traditional schemes, primarily intended for digital distribution. At the same time, we are experiencing radical changes in consumer habits; notably from audiences shying away from tv and theaters to digital platforms. Plus, these platforms are predominantly US; thus, shifting the control of exhibition in Europe away from EU-controlled interests, both public and private.\\nWe believe that the EU Film industry must live up to this challenge by offering an adapted answer both in terms of film creation and distribution. Its future competitivity and relevance depends on its capacity to harness emerging creative forces before they are reaped by the GAFAN. As a result, EDT relies on UMW’s capacity to identify “digital-native” talents whose films are produced outside of traditional circuits. UMW then ensures that these films reach the most prominent platforms in the world, supported by adapted marketing campaigns to effectively address audiences. In short, EDT will over the next 3 years: 1/ build an offer of 20 digital-native EU films, 2/ create and implement adapted marketing strategies, and 3/ coordinate direct-to-digital distribution around the world.\\nThe European dimension of EDT is both operational and political as it aims at renewing and promoting EU creativity and talents in Europe and beyond by relying on the long run on a new business model 100% digital and fully integrated in terms of production and distribution.\\n'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': ['Digital Talents', ' Digital Distribution', ' VOD platforms'], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053124'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-INNOVBUSMOD'], 'overallBudget': ['1095248.79'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":939071551,\"legalName\":\"UNDER THE MILKY WAY INTERNATIONAL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"75002\",\"street\":\"4 RUE DU CAIRE\",\"city\":\"Paris\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"FR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"France\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.8672053\",\"longitude\":\"2.3524531\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"657149\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":true}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['EDT Rise and Shine'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:12.904+0200'], 'euContributionRate': ['60'], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053124/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053124/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['657149'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-02-22T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:12.811+0200'], 'topicId': ['44017955'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053124'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2022-03-01T00:00:00.000+0100'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[{\"id\":\"101053124_PSCREA2027\",\"summary\":\"Under The Milky Way’s (UMW) specific and unique positioning in the film industry is at the origin of Europe Digital Talents (EDT). Indeed, as a film aggregator, UMW acts as an intermediary between rights-holders (producers, distributors, and sales agents) on both global and local VoD platforms around the world. \\\\nSuch a unique positioning allows UMW to reinforce its analysis of the industry’s ongoing digital mutations, and to witness the emergence of a new generation of \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" talents and consumers increasingly deserting traditional distribution networks,\\\\nIn terms of creation, that generation masters the digital technologies, which democratizes the access to production tools, and lowers the barriers of producing films. We are starting to see films in the US that are produced by digital-native talents directly for digital distribution, however that model has yet to emerge in an organized way in Europe. \\\\nAs an audience, the inherent web-culture of younger, digital-savvy audiences, consumes content, including films, online in a different way than older generations. Younger audiences are completely familiar with the different VOD models and are even willing to pay for films released on VOD and theaters at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nAs of today, UMW covers more than 120 territories, works with more than 600 rights holders and has more than 6,000 films under mandate that are currently distributed on more than 50 platforms. \\\\nOver the years, we noticed an increasing number of \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" films that chose UMW’s distribution services to reach their audience. These films, produced in a non-traditional way (i.e. outside of the main traditional funding mechanisms in Europe), are mostly intended for an audience that is also \\\\\"digital-native\\\\\" (16 to 37 years old - aka Millennials / Generation Z). \\\\nMotivated by a strong conviction that this creativity is intended to be shared as widely as possible, UMW hopes that its intervention will contribute to the emergence of new European talents committed to a digital future. \\\\nIn 2019, UMW launched Originals x UMW. As of today, UMW released 26 films under this “digital-native” label directly to multiple VoD platforms. Some of these films are included in the EDT program and can thus benefit from the support of Creative Europe. Launched in 2020, this sub-label included 6 films to be released in 2021. EDT Rise and Shine is the follow up of this action and aims at widening its scope both in terms of content and distribution footprint, and to allow for an industrialized and virtuous model to emerge.\\\\n\\\\nObjectives\\\\n-\\\\tRenewing European talents at global level based on digital distribution networks and their audiences.\\\\nEDT’s approach is to identify such talent and provide them with an initial steppingstone for their projects. The sourcing and management of these digital-native talents coupled with UMW’s global distribution network is an unprecedented and concrete offer to the needs of the industry on the creators’ side.\\\\n-\\\\tStrategically positioning a European company to prevent the GAFANs from pre-empting of new sources of creativity directly, and, as such, providing them with a credible and organized partner. EDT’s unique positioning on smaller budget films allows for the development of a production model that can be, on the hand, economically viable and independent of platform pre-financing, on the other. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tTargeting and addressing an emerging global digital audience. \\\\nThere is an increasingly large audience accessing film content online. This used to be primarily limited to younger digital-savvy audiences, but recent events also changed habits of mature audiences as evidenced by the increasing consumption of films online. EDT addresses this market full of potential and aims at providing platforms with content to help in their diversification. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tOffering the tools, organization and expertise necessary to roll out a new distribution and promotion model in Europe. \\\\nUMW’s expertise as a first mover in the fields of global aggregation allows it to maximize the value of the films and catalogs under management.With its extensive global coverage, and access to all global platforms and of the main local platforms across all VoD business models (TVOD, AVOD, SVOD), as well as through the collection and analysis of sales and revenue data, UMW offers a real “Library Intelligence Solution”, for rights holders. In addition, UMW’s experience through several years of investments in digital marketing provides a concrete benchmark and expertise to ensure efficient digital promotion efforts. \\\\n\\\\n-\\\\tProposing to talents and their producers, a clear and transparent scheme for the exploitation of their films : EDT aims to develop an economic model that is both direct and flexible and ensures total transparency allowing in the medium-long term to function without pre-financing models as royalties flow back in a regular and efficient way.

At the general project level: A regularly updated website that serves as a showcase for the project. In addition, a communication campaign was set up in Cannes to publicize the project and recruit films.\\\\n. At the level of each film release: tailor-made marketing strategies are created with the strong involvement of the film teams.\\\\n\\\\n1.3 Coordination of direct-to-digital VOD distribution around the world : In terms of distribution, our positioning as an aggregator has enabled us to target a very large number of platforms and to optimize the operating model (from TVOD to AVOD via the T-SVOD offered by Amazon) in order to to guarantee the greatest possible coverage for films in terms of operating platform\",\"finalResults\":\"•\\\\tImpact in terms of availability and geographical coverage: It is still too early to analyze the results of the first films, insofar as there are only a few months of exploitation.

It is the aim to have the films circulate in countries outside of Europe.\\\\n\\\\nFSS enables companies to create additional promotional tools, to improve new digital approaches and experiment with innovative ideas. It is paramount for films at international film festivals and markets to receive a prominent promotion so that they may stand out amongst the vast number of available films to be sold to as many international countries as possible.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2004, FSS has been instrumental in augmenting promotional campaigns of more than 2,540 films from the whole of Europe. Almost 50% of these films have been sold to countries in overseas.\\\\n\\\\nFSS complements EFP’s (European Film Promotion’s) manifold pan-European promotion initiatives.

The Shanghai International Film Festival was recently cancelled and the Beijing International Film Festival was postponed to August 22; the latter therefore was not part of the current contract and call.\",\"finalResults\":\"The sales companies have successfully used FSS for their digital campaigns to promote a total of 166 finished and unfinished films from Europe to overseas buyers at 4 prominent international film festivals, 4 markets outside of Europe and 2 major online markets inside of Europe with an international outward reach (the European Film Market, EFM, and the Marché du Film in Cannes) in the contract period. This year, there were no requests to promote European films at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin and the HotDocs Documentary Film Festival in Toronto but this can change every year depending on the festivals\\\\u0027 selection. \\\\n\\\\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, the Shanghai International Film Festival was cancelled and the Beijing International Film Fesival postponed to August 22. \\\\n\\\\nThe trend to work on a \\\\u0027holistic\\\\u0027 digital basis has meanwhile become common business practise for European world sales companies, in particular when reaching out to buyers outside of Europe who have been restricting their travels due to the pandemic. Working together with Europe\\\\u0027s most prolific world sales companies and the exchange of intelligence results in providing EFP with first-hand information on the different markets and up-to-date buyers\\\\u0027 habits outside of Europe.\\\\n\\\\nWith FSS, the sales companies have the opportunity to refine the production of digital promotion material that appeals to buyers around the world and triggers online interest in the films on various levels. Most of the sales agents have heavily expanded on their social media activities and hired professional digital marekting companies.

The slate is composed of three feature films with a cinematographic pretension, and a one-off series targeted to television or platform audiences. Firstly, we present ‘Dismantling the elephant’, the first feature film by the young Catalan director, Aitor Echeverría, a family drama that addresses the issue of alcoholism as a point of conflict between a mother and a daughter.In this way, AMP continues to promote new creative talent by supporting new directors. The second feature of AMPS is 'The secret of the Magi', written and directed by Nacho Sánchez Quevedo and Javier Dampierre in what will also be their first adventure in the world of animation. A 3D animated film whose protagonists, the Three Wise Men, will conquer children's audiences around the world, and will serve to boost the animation industry in Spain. Thirdly, we highlight the one-off series ‘Ravalear’ by Pol Rodriguez. A story that is born from the most personal family drama to encompass a project in the form of a thriller that will reflect the multicultural, social, and political reality that takes place in one of the most emblematic neighbourhoods of Barcelona, the Raval. Finally, AMPS includes the feature film ‘She saves the children’, a biopic narrated under the creative freedom of its authors, to tell us the story of Eglantyne Jebb, the founder of the international NGO Save the children. The project is a high value production that will be shot entirely in English, shooted mainly in Ireland and will have an international well-known casting. This will be an most ambitious production of AMPS, and we once again trust director Ibon Cormenzana to lead this project with such a personal take.\"], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053145'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-DEVSLATE'], 'overallBudget': ['235000'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":899755608,\"legalName\":\"ARCADIA MOTION PICTURES SL\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"08005\",\"street\":\"CIUDAD DE GRANADA 45, 1-1\",\"city\":\"Barcelona\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"ES\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Spain\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"41.370449300000004\",\"longitude\":\"2.1500219563810696\",\"activityType\":\"Private for profit organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"235000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['AMPS'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 - 2027'], 'programmes': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'esDA_IngestDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:17.544+0200'], 'euContributionRate': [], 'url': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053145/CREA2027'], 'esST_URL': ['uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053145/CREA2027'], 'euContributionAmount': ['235000'], 'ecSignatureDate': ['2022-05-31T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'esDA_QueueDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:17.453+0200'], 'topicId': ['44001627'], 'programDescription': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'fundedUnder': ['Creative Europe Programme (CREA)'], 'programAbbreviation': ['CREA2027'], 'projectId': ['101053145'], 'programId': ['43251814'], 'startDate': ['2021-08-30T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'publications': ['[]'], 'summaries': ['[]'], 'status': ['Open']}, 'enrichedMetadata': {}, 'children': [], 'highlightedFragments': []}, {'apiVersion': '2.120', 'reference': '43251814101053149', 'url': 'uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43251814/101053149/CREA2027', 'title': None, 'contentType': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'databaseLabel': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'database': 'SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD', 'summary': 'IndieLisboa International Film Festival', 'weight': 1.0, 'groupById': None, 'content': 'IndieLisboa International Film Festival', 'accessRestriction': False, 'pages': None, 'checksum': 'B574F4898E9AAE2A8CAD77CB01646FF5CA17F40F599C195378A163F6CD2BD1F0', 'metadata': {'subTypeOfAction': [], 'typeOfAction': ['CREA Lump Sum Grants'], 'es_SortDate': ['2024-05-15T13:07:18.750+0200'], 'endDate': ['2023-09-06T01:00:00.000+0200'], 'projectWebsite': [], 'language': ['en'], 'title': ['IndieLisboa International Film Festival'], 'deliverables': ['[{\"id\":\"101053149_1_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Festival Catalogue 2022\",\"description\":\"Electronic (available on website) and printed (aprox. 5000 copies); Portuguese and English; aprox. 80 pages\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"IndieLisboa – International Film Festival 2022, 19th Edition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2022-05-30\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5ebdb8640/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101053149_3_DELIVCREA2027\",\"title\":\"Festival Catalogue 2023\",\"description\":\"Electronic (available on website) and printed (aprox. 5000 copies); Portuguese and English; aprox. 80 pages\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"IndieLisboa – International Film Festival 2023, 20th Edition\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-09-27\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-01-12 09:06:11\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5faebab58/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]'], 'esST_checksum': ['B574F4898E9AAE2A8CAD77CB01646FF5CA17F40F599C195378A163F6CD2BD1F0'], 'objective': ['IndieLisboa International Film Festival focuses on the exhibition of works that fill the void of film circulation shaped by the mainstream production and exhibition dominating the market.

The festival also aims to draw a spotlight on the discovery of Portuguese recent films through its national competitions and industry-oriented activities.  IndieLisboa is also a festival that focuses on a program designed specifically for the industry (audience of film professionals, filmmakers, producers, sales agents, programmers, critics, etc.). This industry core, parallel to the screenings program, is composed of workshops, masterclasses, debates, a script-writing lab, a film fund, a pitching forum, screenings of works in progress and also several networking events, among other activities.

Our 1st edition happened in 2004 and our programming grew in scale, offering a more diversified offer over the years, adding our IndieJúnior section in 2005 with the intent to work on young audiences development, and other sections as Industry, IndieMusic and its relation to IndieyNight, and we always aim to expand even further, establishing new partnerships every year.\\\\n\\\\nIndieLisboa focuses on bringing independent cinema closer to the audiences and on the organisation and promotion of film literacy initiatives. The festival shows mostly European works in competitions of both young and renowned directors, with concerned emphasis on countries with low levels of film production. Our organisation shows films that do not reach the regular distribution circuit, thus filling a gap that largely diversifies national cultural offer. The festival is also a platform to premiere and release new films, thus an important ally for Portuguese distributors. The festival fosters cultural and linguistic diversity by diversifying its geographical scope (in 2022 we showed films from 28 MEDIA countries, including 78 films from low audiovisual capacity countries. In 2023 edition\\\\u0027s we showed films from 25 MEDIA countries, including 125 films from low audiovisual capacity countries)\\\\n\\\\nWe continue to work on the growth of film literacy activities for younger audiences by expanding the range of partner schools and universities throughout the country and by offering diversified workshops throughout the school year. To the greatest extent, IndieLisboa aims to draw the spotlight to European productions and also to the discovery of Portuguese recent films (and also works in progress) through its competitions and industry oriented activities. Activities beyond regular screenings - workshops for children, workshops for film students, masterclasses, debates, new projects labs, a film fund, a pitching forum, screenings of works in progress, networking events, etc. – are our goal as we want to continue to expand the festival.  At the same time we continue to invest on a broad policy of invited guests, consistently supporting our mission.\",\"paymentDate\":\". .\",\"workPerformed\":\"In 2022, the 19th edition of IndieLisboa IFF registered 25.533 spectators, of which 24.296 in the theatre and 1.237 in online sessions for schools. The retrospective revisited the work of North-American director Doris Wishman, female pioneer in sexploitation production from the 60s. The focus of the Silvestre section celebrated the 40th anniversary of French distributor Light Cone, one of the great promoters of experimental cinema in France and in the world. Not to mention the return of IndiebyNight, the festival’s programme of parties and concerts, after two editions in pause. And also the IndieJúnior school programme, that this year returned to the cinemas after two editions taking place only online. In 2022, the Industry+Talks program was reduced to the Lisbon Screenings and the LisbonTalks. The Lisbon Screenings, an activity meant to promote Portuguese cinema among foreign professionals and to whom participation is restricted, continued to take place solely online. The LisbonTalks was dedicated to the new waves, sub-genres and ways of making cinema. \\\\n\\\\nIn 2023, the edition celebrating 20 years of IndieLisboa - International Film Festival marked the return to full-screen theatres and the pre-pandemic numbers of the festival, in an edition with 30 thousand spectators. Between April 27 and May 7, the film sessions occupied the usual venues of the festival plus 2 new venues. The retrospective \\\\\"Jan Švankmajer, The Surrealist\\\\\" revisited the work of one of the most interesting and indispensable living directors, born in Prague and owner of a restless art. The section Silvestre brought films dedicated to labour and trade union movement. Also of note is IndiebyNight, the festival\\\\u0027s programme of parties and concerts. For the Industry a program dedicated to film professionals that this year had five different activities: LisbonTalks by NOVA FCSH, Lisbon Screenings, Film Support Fund, IndieLab by NOVA FCSH and a Co-Production Forum, the latter two in their first edition. A new festival website was launched two months before the beginning of the edition. Finally, we highlight 2 new activities and a return to the festival. 2023 marked the first edition of IndieDate, a blind date at a film screening, and the Cinema at the Pool sessions with sessions for young and adult audiences that were all sold out. Mouth of Madness Marathon returned, after on hiatus since 2019. 7 consecutive hours of genre movies from 11pm to 6am.\",\"finalResults\":\"The 19th and 20th edition of IndieLisboa - International Film Festival were marked by the return of the festival to its original dates in Spring, after two years occupying the calendar at the end of Summer due to the pandemic. We saw in 2022 a slow return of people to movie theaters, but that in 2023 showed numbers very close to the pre-pandemic scenario. Between 2022 and 2023 we had an increase of almost 6000 viewers which is very significant. Two new activities have proven to be very successful among the public. On the one hand, the cinema sessions at the swimming pool, one of the novelties of the 20th edition, which sold out the 3 existing sessions, two of which for a family audience, for a total of 300 people. On the other hand, the novelty IndieDate a new experience for those who like surprises. A blind date during a film session, from a romantic date to a cinephile friendship.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral indicators show a continuous growth of the festival in the last two editions:\\\\n\\\\n- Higher number of films submitted (+9%)\\\\n- More spectators (+17%)\\\\n- More children, young people and families (+14%)\\\\n- Increase in the number of accredited and film professionals (398 in 2022 and 616 in 2023)\\\\n\\\\nIn 2023 we launched a new website, a major development in the last 2 years, more modern and intuitive and with a better user experience design.\\\\n\\\\nAs planned, we created in 2022, \\\\\"Cinema de Colo\\\\\", a special program during the festival aimed at the youngest of audiences, babies from 4 up tp 36 months, reinforcing our aim to work on audience development at very young ages.

The workshop includes interactive lectures, up-to-date case studies, group work sessions and many networking opportunities. Additionally, in an Expert Speed-Dating session, participants had the exclusive chance to discuss their current projects with various experts.\\\\n\\\\nOur workshop Digital Distribution – Maximizing Reach and Revenues took place in December 2022 in Berlin. The aim of the workshop – to offer information on the newest trends, relevant players, digital platforms and tools as well as hands-on advice and guidance to maximize reach and revenue as well as strategies for resourceful marketing and successful audience engagement – was successfully achieved through the participation of six experienced lecturers, The 16 participants from 12 European countries not only learned best practices through case studies, and received updates on new tools, B2B and B2C marketing strategies for different kinds of digital distribution but were also tasked to create a fictional digital marketing and distribution strategy in group work sessions.\\\\n\\\\nOur long-running workshop European Co-Production: Legal and Financial Aspects took place at the beginning of March 2023. The 20 participants from 14 countries took a deep dive into the topic of European co-productions, with sessions ranging from project financing and the legal framework to case studies of recent European co-productions. The eight experts joined from five European countries, and were not only available to the participants during their sessions, but also joined the many networking opportunities, allowing for even more exchange.\\\\n\\\\nA new addition were the compact online seminars on the topics Virtual Production, AI: Ethics and Legal Aspects and Greening the Industry.\\\\n\\\\nAI: Ethics and Legal Aspects was the first of the online seminars, taking place in May 2022. The experts Niklas Maamar (Legal Researcher) and Ramak Molavi Vasse´i (Digital Rights Lawyer and Innovation Law Expert) offered participants an overview on the current state of AI and broke down the most important legal and ethical aspects. Participants were also introduced to useful AI applications for the audiovisual industry, such as Largo and Limecraft.\\\\n\\\\nThe online seminar Virtual Production took place in June 2022. The goal of the seminar was to introduce professionals to the different kinds of virtual production, the basics of how to run a virtual production and when and where the technology presents a key asset to state-of-the-art content production. Lectures by Evgeny Kalachikhin (Art Director \\\\u0026 VP Supervisor) and Louisa Bremner (Virtual Production Supervisor) provided participants with a deeper understanding of virtual production and its possibilities and challenges. Case studies of recent productions that included virtual production made the technology more tangible for the attending professionals.\\\\n\\\\nThe last online seminar was Greening the Industry which took place in September 2022. The seminar offered audiovisual professionals helpful strategies and tools to make their productions more environmentally friendly and showed that sustainability and economic success do not have to be mutually exclusive. Acclaimed experts such as Roser Canela Mas shared their knowledge and by including case studies of the Polish low budget productions THE MOTHS (D: Piotr Stasik) and LIPSTICK ON THE GLASS (D: Kuba Czekaj), participants learned that it is possible to make an impact even on a small scale.\\\\n\\\\nThe eTraining Green Production was released in April 2023. It was produced with the help of five international experts who have much experience in the field of sustainable productions. The experts of the eTraining are coming from five different European countries, representing a wide range of perspectives. Among the experts are Anne Puolanne (Audiovisual Producers Finland APFI), Louise Marie Smith (Neptune Sustainability) and Roman Russo (Green Toolkit) and they cover everything from politics and regulations, and standards, initiatives and tools in Europe to collaborations with funders and broadcasters and case studies of sustainable productions.\",\"finalResults\":\"It is difficult to already describe the results and impact of the activities since some of them only took place a few months ago, therefore it is not possible to already see long-term results.

The CEEA Forum includes a pitching competition, 1:1 meetings and an industry programme. It consists of a sizable event in the Czech Republic and two regional events in Croatia and Slovenia. CEEA Experience is a series of masterclasses that presents current trends and strategies to national and regional communities of professionals. A less visible, but even more important activity is CEEA Bricks which aims to encourage financiers in the CEE region to be more proactive in favour of animation. Another output will be a guide aimed at more closely acquainting people and organisations with the animation industry of the CEE region. CEEA Talents works with young talents and aims to present their creativity to general audiences in addition to other film professionals. We target the development of new innovation - in particular helping young authors by creating two support regional programmes (Forum), encouraging the engagement of CEE film funds and broadcasters (Bricks) and expanding the support programme of debuting authors (Talents).'], 'esST_FileName': ['file.txt'], 'freeKeywords': [], 'DATASOURCE': ['SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD'], 'REFERENCE': ['43251814101053179'], 'subProgramme': [], 'topicAbbreviation': ['CREA-MEDIA-2021-MARKETNET'], 'overallBudget': ['252500'], 'topicDescription': [], 'participants': ['[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":897529749,\"legalName\":\"CEE ANIMATION EHZS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"150 00\",\"street\":\"NA DOUBKOVE 2040/8\",\"city\":\"PRAHA 5\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"CZ\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Czechia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.0756334\",\"longitude\":\"14.4062009\",\"activityType\":\"Private for profit organisation\",\"eucontribution\":\"51000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938951853,\"legalName\":\"ASOCIACE ANIMOVANEHO FILMU ZS\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"170 00\",\"street\":\"HERMANOVA 413/3\",\"city\":\"PRAHA 7\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"CZ\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Czechia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"50.0998276\",\"longitude\":\"14.4228633\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"36000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938264317,\"legalName\":\"DRUSTVO SLOVENSKEGA ANIMIRANEGA FILMA\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"1000\",\"street\":\"KERSNIKOVA ULICA 12\",\"city\":\"Ljubljana\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SI\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Slovenia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"46.0563035\",\"longitude\":\"14.5040999\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"30000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":3,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938223674,\"legalName\":\"STOWARZYSZENIE PRODUCENTOW POLSKIEJ ANIMACJI\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"02-595\",\"street\":\"UL PULAWSKA 61\",\"city\":\"WARSZAWA\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"PL\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Poland\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"52.1978644\",\"longitude\":\"21.0241935\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"15000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":4,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":947636942,\"legalName\":\"HULAHOP DOO ZA FILMSKU PRODUKCIJU IUSLUGE\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"10 000\",\"street\":\"VLASKA ULICA 79\",\"city\":\"Zagreb\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"HR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Croatia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.788324700000004\",\"longitude\":\"15.933813568165476\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"15000\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":5,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"PRC\",\"sme\":true},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":938329986,\"legalName\":\"ASOCIACIA PRODUCENTOV ANIMOVANEHO FILMU\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"900 85\",\"street\":\"VISTUK 277\",\"city\":\"VISTUK\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SK\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Slovakia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.3343451\",\"longitude\":\"17.38809489132994\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"4500\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":6,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false}]'], 'es_ContentType': ['text/plain'], 'acronym': ['CEEA SIP'], 'programmePeriod': ['2021 -

The main topics included immersive and multimodal storytelling, co-creation methodologies, impact and outreach strategies. We inspired our participants to find new ways to develop participatory projects that include the audience from the early stages, crossing borders between documentary and fiction and finding unusual and surprising ways of storytelling, be it in short or long forms. Participants worked on their impact strategies, elaborating on their target audience. At the end of Phase 1, participants received mentoring on their projects, building on the inputs they collected during Phase 1.\\\\nThe focus of Phase 2 - which stretched on several online sessions - was on assessing the experimentation started before, strengthening and condensing it into a coherent and feasible outline. Participants refined the storytelling format of their projects and got more practical tools to further develop their impact strategy. In preparation for the pitching in Phase 3, we also held a two-part masterclass on teasers: in the first, participants received thorough comments and feedback on their materials, and re-elaborated their teaser for the second meeting. Between Phase 2 and 3, participants had a second round of mentoring, focused on preparing their visual and written materials for the pitch. \\\\nPhase 3 focused on the participants’ presentation skills and supporting them in the preparation of a “recorded pitch” and a “traditional pitch”, including a pitch deck composed of a short 2-page presentation of their project, a longer and more detailed written presentation and the visual elements (e.g. teaser, prototype). \\\\nIn the first online part participants joined group sessions where they discussed and refined the content, the rhythm and the structure of their presentation; they worked on their body language and their mindset in a pitching situation in one-to-one meetings. At the end of the online phase, participants produced an “online pitch deck”. \\\\nThe residential part took place in Vilnius in partnership with Inconvenient Film Festival. The first days we provided our participants with focused coaching sessions for the live setting. During the course of two mornings, all projects developed at ESoDoc were presented in front of an international panel of experts. In the afternoons, our participants had the chance to meet the panellists in one-to-one meetings to follow up on their presentations. We organised an Industry Day, in partnership with the Creative Europe Desk Lithuania, opening to the public masterclasses and lectures about the workshop’s themes (crossmedia; short formats; impact; unconscious bias). \\\\nIn Phase 4 (Follow-up) we delivered practical masterclasses on specific industry-related topics (international co-productions, distribution and festival strategies), followed by one-to-one meetings with the experts to discuss practical implementation onto their projects. We also organised a series of presentations of film-industry institutions (IDM film commission; Voice of America) and EU-supported training dok.incubator, as well as an informative session to present the various opportunities offered by Creative Europe. We used the “online pitch deck” to organise matchmaking sessions with various producers available through the ESoDoc network.

At the end of the workshop, their initial ideas were developed into a solid and cohesive structure that allows our participants to confidently access the market looking for partnerships and further collaborations, thanks also to a refined pitch deck that will be constantly updated following the indications received at ESoDoc. \\\\nParticipants increased their knowledge of the latest technological developments and their implementation across the spectrum, gaining new awareness of the new market trends and the new possibilities also resulting from broader partnerships that go beyond the audiovisual sector.
